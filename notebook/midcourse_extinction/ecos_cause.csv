"Ozark cavefish grow at a slow rate, approximately 0.6 millimeters every month, and have a long lifespan. Because they are only viable in the wild and conservation measures restrict the capture of this species, a measure of average lifespan in captivity is not available. However, the average lifespan of wild populations is approximately 10 years(Poulson, 1963)."
"Olive-sided Flycatchers appear to respond positively to certain types of harvested forests, but spraying pesticides may be detrimental to their food supply in some areas. Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data indicate widespread declines in Olive-sided Flycatcher populations. Declines are relatively consistent in magnitude across the breeding range, with an overall 3.9% annual decline from 1966 through 1996. Examination of BBS data by early (1966-1979) and recent (1980-1996) time periods indicates that declines increased during the latter period, and these declines have continued up to 2007. For more information on this species, refer to the following resource:

"There are two other subspecies of this group:  Hesperia leonardus leonardus occurs in the eastern United States and Canada, and Hesperia leonardus pawnee occurs on the Northern Great Plains.  The presence of ventral hind wing spots and its darker color differentiates Hesperia leonardus montana from Hesperia leonardus pawnee.

Since modern settlement of Colorado, the Platte River Canyon has experienced a number of habitat changes that likely have resulted in loss, modification, and curtailment of former skipper habitat and range.  Habitat loss likely has occurred as a result of fire suppression over the last 120 years.  The encroachment of conifers and the subsequent loss of grasses and prairie gayfeather have reduced the quality and quantity of skipper habitat.  Causes of lost habitat include Cheesman Reservoir, catastrophic fire, residential development, roads, and planted and mowed pastures.  Invasion of noxious weeds, such as knapweed, which may outcompete blue grama and prairie gayfeather are also a serious threat to the skipper.

"Mating behavior has been rarely documented. It is not well known if the PRHB mates during a particular month of the year or year-round. "
"The author of the Colorado Flora considers Mosquito Range mustard
(E. penlandii) to be a variety of E.edwardsii, hence the synonym E. edwardsii var. penlandii.  Mosquito Range mustard was recently synonymized with E. edwardsii in the Flora of North America's.  In contrast, another study has found Mosquito Range mustard and E. edwardsii to be distinct from one another based on novel alleles, genetic diversity patterns, differences in morphology (morphometric measurements), and chromosome counts.  Further research is underway that will provide a more comprehensive overview of the relationship between Mosquito Range mustard and E. edwardsii."
"Habitat loss, alteration, degradation, and fragmentation resulting from urban development, flood control, water development and other human land uses, especially in riparian habitat, have adversely impacted PMJM populations. "
"Pondberry is a distinctive species, with diagnostic characters that clearly distinguish it from the other two species of spicebush found in the southeastern United States, spicebush (L. benzoin) and bog spicebush (L. subcoriacea)."
"The global population has been estimated to be in the region of 4,000-7,000 breeding pairs, and declining rapidly, in places by up to 90% since 1950 (Butchart and Baker 2000). Available evidence indicates that as the number of eggs laid at a communal nesting site declines, so too does the efficacy of communal nesting as a predator satiation strategy, hence the viability of many smaller populations is becoming increasingly threatened (Gorog et al. 2005)."
"Key morphological features that differentiate Isoetes taxa are megaspore ornamentation, texture, and size, and length of the velum (a membranous flap of tissue covering the sporangium). Megaspores are white and reticulate-cristate in texture with relatively thick proximal ridges; they measure 500 to 625 micrometers (approximately 0.02 in.) in diameter. Surface texture of the girdle (a narrow band along the distal side of the equatorial ridge encircling the megaspore) is obscure and not distinguishable from the overall texture of the spore. Microspores are light brown in mass and densely spinulose; they measure 25 to 35 micrometers (approximately 0.001 in.) in diameter. The velum in I. louisianensis covers less than one-half of the adaxial wall of the sporangium and the sporangial wall is brown-streaked. Biosystematic studies indicate that this species is a tetraploid (2n=44)."
"Camou et al. (1998) found that masked bobwhite populations increased in 11 of 13 years when mean summer precipitation was >20 cm (7.9 in.), but declined in 13 of 14 years when mean summer precipitation was <20 cm.  High temperatures in combination with dry atmospheric conditions may reduce the amount of thermally suitable habitat (Guthery et al. 2001c) as heat reduces the proportion of bobwhite hens that lay eggs and the proportion of males that produce sperm.

Casual observations by BANWR staff of mortalities of captive masked bobwhites held in outdoor pens with varying degrees of cover seem to indicate that there may be a lowered tolerance for extreme cold temperatures.  When night-time temperatures drop into the 10 to 20 degree Fahrenheit (F) range (-12 to -7 degree Celsius (C)), or when cold and rainy conditions occur together, birds are sometimes found dead in roost rings.  It is not known how this might affect truly wild birds, since the captive birds had limited choices for seeking cover, and wild birds may be able to move out of colder areas into better roost sites.

"Few northeastern beach tiger beetle sites are protected and many are threatened by human activities.  Loss of this beetle from most of its range has been attributed primarily to destruction and disturbance of natural beach habitat from shoreline development, beach stabilization, and high levels of recreational use.  Additional threats include pollution, pesticides, oil slicks, and off-road vehicle traffic.  Natural limiting factors include winter storms, beach erosion, flood tides, hurricanes, parasites, and predators."
"Disturbance at nest sites and destruction of habitat are threats to the species."
"Because the species is so limited in range, the magnitude of threats that are occurring now are high, and those that may impact the species in the foreseeable future are high as well.  Predation by nonnative crayfish is currently threatening the Three Forks springsnail across its entire range.  In addition to the current threats, the Three Forks springsnail is also at a high risk of extinction due to threats that could affect the species in the foreseeable future, such as the use of fire retardant chemicals during future wildfires, the potential spread and competition with New Zealand springsnails, and the potential for climate change and drought to dry its springhead habitat."
"Difficult to see this species in the wild.  However, several are on display at the Texas River Center near Spring Lake, In San Marcos."
"An analysis of
cross-breeding studies with this
species indicates that it is actually a
variation of the common sweet birch.
Cultivated birch seedlings have
increased the current population
numbers. While the single natural
population has continued to dwindle,
recovery for the round-leaf birch
hinges on the successful
establishment of these cultivated
populations."
"Loss, fragmentation, and degradation of scrub and woodland habitats are major concerns for San Clemente Spotted Towhee conservation. Feral herbivore grazing and feral pig rooting has increased the susceptibility of towhees to predation from native and introduced nest predators. Due to habitat degradation, the San Clemente Spotted Towhee was extirpated from its island namesake. Since there is a lack of quantitative data on towhee numbers on Santa Rosa and Santa Catalina prior to the introduction of non-native grazing mammals, it is difficult to know if their populations on these islands have declined or increased.

"Loss and degradation of dense riparian habitats are the primary habitat threat to the flycatcher.  Historically, water developments that altered flows in the rivers and streams were the primary threat.  Now, with riparian areas limited and re-growth difficult due to changes in flows, fire is a significant risk to remaining habitats.  Human disturbances at nesting sites may result in nest abandonment."
"Loss of habitat, as well as human encroachment on the birds' habitat, are factors in their decline. The rangewide Streaked Horned Larks population is estimated to be about 2,000. Partners in Flight estimates Horned Larks as a whole to have a global breeding population of 120 million, with 17 percent breeding in Canada, 62 percent spending some part of the year in the U.S., and 9 percent in Mexico.

"The endangered whooping crane is a flagship species for the North American wildlife conservation movement, symbolizing the struggle for survival that characterizes endangered species worldwide.  The Aransas-Wood Buffalo flock has come back from a low of only 15 birds in 1941 to reach 270 individuals in 2008, with annual growth averaging 4.6%.  A record 74 nesting pairs were located in May, 2010.  In the United States, the whooping crane was listed as endangered in 1970 by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  In Canada, the crane was designated as threatened in 1978 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and listed as endangered under the Canadian Species at Risk Act in 2003.  The International Recovery Plan was last updated in 2007.

Historically, population declines were caused by shooting and destruction of nesting habitat in the prairies from agricultural development. The species was listed because of low population numbers, slow reproductive potential (sexual maturity is delayed and pairs average less than one chick annually), cyclic nesting and wintering habitat suitability, a hazardous 4,000 km migration route that is traversed twice annually, and many human pressures on the wintering grounds.  Current threats to wild cranes include collisions with manmade objects such as power lines and fences, shooting, chemical spills along the Intracoastal Waterway that bisects its winter habitat, predators, disease, habitat destruction, severe weather, and a loss of two thirds of the original genetic material.  Threats to the captive flock include disease, accidents, and in-breeding.
"
"Important threats:  loss of marsh habitat through channelization, dredging/filling activities, decline in quality of marsh habitat due to build-up residual vegetation (dead stems and leaves of cattails or bulrush) that clogs movement through the vegetation, and selenium contamination of the prey base. "
"Maximum lifespan is around five years (McDaniel 1984).  "
"In the West, much of the Yellow-Billed Cuckoos riparian habitat has been converted to farmland and housing, leading to population declines and the possible extirpation of cuckoos from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada. Once common in the California Central Valley, coastal valleys, and riparian habitats east of the Sierra Nevada, habitat loss now constrains the California breeding population to small numbers of birds. As long-distance, nocturnal migrants, Yellow-Billed Cuckoos are also vulnerable to collisions with tall buildings, cell towers, radio antennas, wind turbines, and other structures.Yellow-billed Cuckoo populations declined by 1.6 percent per year between 1966 and 2010. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at about 9 million, with 84 percent breeding in the U.S., 10 percent in Mexico, and none in Canada.

"Per a 2017 statewide survey, there are at least 6620 Florida manatees.  A recent estimate of statewide Florida manatee abundance is 8,810 with 95% probability (actual abundance between 7,520 and 10,280).  Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico are thought to include about 140 animals.  Both stocks are thought to be stable and perhaps increasing in certain areas.  Survival and reproductive rates are generally positive, even in the face of increasing human-related threats, including watercraft, habitat loss, and other activities."
"Habitat alteration and increased use of recreational beaches threaten the conservation of this species.  Also at risk from sea level rise and stochastic events such as oil spills. The breeding population has likely decreased on the Gulf Coast since late 1800s.

"In its recovery plan (USFWS 1996) the Service mostly reiterated the threats it described in the final listing rule, but emphasized that conversion of habitat to cropland was the greatest remaining threat to southern populations.  It also emphasized that little was known about how to ensure that burning, grazing, and mowing are conducted in a manner not adverse to western prairie fringed orchid populations and pointed out that actions that directly or indirectly lower water levels in the rooting zone of plants have the potential of serious adverse impacts.  In addition, it implied that potential impacts of pesticides to western prairie fringed orchid and its pollinators was also a threat.  

As with the conservation of other rare prairie species that exist in fragments of a once vast ecosystem, successful management consists of careful application of practices that are essential for conserving the habitat, while ensuring that associated adverse effects are avoided or minimized.
"
"The primary reasons for the decline of Burrowing Owls have been identified as the elimination of burrowing mammals through control programs and habitat loss (USFWS 2002). Concerns with wind development and Burrowing Owls include habitat destruction and fragmentation (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 9). Collision with wind turbines is also a potential risk for this species as demonstrated by the mass mortality at the Altamont Pass facility (Smallwood and Thelander 2008).  "
"Annual or facultatively perennial. Produces large amounts of seed."
"The species is threatened by various land uses (road and utility corridor construction, urban development, recreation uses, livestock grazing, mining activities, and military activities), over collecting, slow recruitment rate, and drought."
"Threats to the chub are from land management activities in the watershed, including mining, livestock grazing, and surface water development that may reduce flows.  Erosion of fine sediments off degraded watersheds, including from poorly designed and maintained roads is also a threat.  Changes in how water flows into the stream, and the amount of sediments carried, can fill in pools needed for dry season survival and deposit fine sediments that cover the sands and gravels preferred by the species.  Human use of the area, particularly during the dry season, may result in contamination of the refuge pool habitats, or the direct reduction in water there if humans or animals drink from the pools."
"Further habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the primary threats to the Samuels Song Sparrow. Alteration of marsh habitat by invasive cord grass (Spartina spp.) may also have adverse effects. There also are concerns that habitat fragmentation and lack of sufficient dispersal corridors will impede dispersal following catastrophic disturbance or habitat changes (Scollon 1993, Cogswell 2000). Breeding Bird Survey data is inadequate for trend assessment.  For more information on this species, refer to the following resource:

"Habitat loss has been a major threat to the Alameda Song Sparrow. However, the State of California and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired 15,100 ha of salt ponds in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay for wetland restoration. With this, the potential habitat for the Alameda Song Sparrow is likely to double (Philip Williams & Associates et al. 2005).The Breeding Bird Survey is inadequate for monitoring changes in the population dynamics of this subspecies as it is restricted to tidal salt marshes, which are inaccessible and ineffectively surveyed from roads. However, standardized point counts conducted annually within the tidal marsh habitat could provide an index of breeding population size and trends. For more information on this species, refer to the following resource:

"Further habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the primary threats to the Suisun Song Sparrow. Alteration of marsh habitat by non-native invasive Cord Grass may also have adverse effects. Increased diversion of fresh water from the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers has caused increases in salinity in Suisun Bay, which may eventually favor vegetation adapted to saline rather than brackish conditions, since prime habitat for maxillaris is tidal marshes. Current data available through Breeding Bird Surveys and Christmas Bird Counts are inadequate for monitoring population trends of this subspecies.

"Associated vegetation includes sparse pinyon-juniper or mountain brush communities (Armstrong 1992, USDA 1999). Associated species include the yellow-flowered buckwheat (Eriogonum brevicaule), Amelanchier alnifolia (Nutt.) Nutt. (serviceberry), Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak), Stipa hymenoides (Indian ricegrass), and houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Clay phacelia does not do well in competition with other vegetation, and the actively eroding shale slopes where this species occurs likely discourages competitors (Aanderud and Harper 1997; USDA 1999). Additional associated vegetative cover include sparse stands of pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) or mountain brush (Amelanchier alnifolia-Cercocarpus montanus-Rhus aromatica) (Armstrong 1992).

"In all regions within the range of the lynx in the contiguous United States, timber harvest, recreation, and their related activities are the predominant land uses affecting lynx habitat.  The primary factor that caused the lynx to be listed was the lack of guidance for the conservation of lynx and snowshoe hare habitat in plans for federally managed lands.  Landscape connectivity between lynx populations and habitats in Canada and the contiguous United States must be maintained.  Lynx movements may be negatively affected by high traffic volume on roads that bisect suitable lynx habitat, such as in the Southern Rockies, and in some areas, mortalities due to road kill are high.

"
"Early decline was due to the loss of habitat, mainly conversion of natural habitats to cropland and pasture.  Current decline is mainly due to the loss of habitat from the drainage and development of wetlands. Other reasons for the current decline include succession to woody vegetation, competition from non-native species and over-collection.

"The Florida salt marsh vole is believed to represent a relict population of the widespread meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) which was much more widespread in Florida during the Pleistocene.  The range of the species in Florida is believed to have been greatly reduced as climatic change resulted in vegetational changes from grassland to forest in Florida.  The current restricted population is threatened by storm surges association with hurricanes and tropical storms, the loss of coastal marshes due to flooding from rising sea level, and potentially by any human-caused alterations that might be proposed for these salt marshes."
"Loss of natural aquatic habitats and predation/competition from introduced non-native fish, frogs, and crayfish resulted in the elimination of natural pupfish populations from Arizona.  The small reintroduction sites are at risk from contamination by non-native species accidentally or purposely transported from other aquatic sites.  Groundwater extraction, and erosion off the watershed also adversely affect these small habitats by increasing sedimentation into the habitat: decreasing its size and interfering with the food base."
"DeBeque phacelia seeds can remain dormant for 5 years (and probably longer) until the combination and timing of temperature and precipitation are optimal for germination."
"A member of the Viorna section of the Clematis genus, C. socialis superficially resembles the more widespread C. crispa, but is distinguished by its erect stems, rhizomatous growth habit, solitary flowers, and lack of tendrils. The species also resembles C. glaucophylla, C. reticulata, and C. viorna, but none of these species are colonial."
"Alabama beach mice are noctural, semi-fossorial rodents. They build complex burrows in the coastal dune ecosystem of Alabama.  Each burrow consist of an entrance tunnel, a nest chamber, and an escape tunnel.  A burrow can be built in one day or over several days.  The nest chamber is located approximately three feet below ground level.  "
"The primary concern for Akikiki conservation is the degradation of habitat, which may be attributed to conversion of native forests to agricultural land, invasion of exotic plants and animals, and human habitation. Highest densities of Akikiki are in the center of the Alaka'i Swamp with 101-200 birds/km^2, declining to 1-10 birds/km^2 in northwestern region. Results of surveys conducted in 1981, 1989, and 1994 indicate the population seriously declined between 1981 and 1989, but returned to previous levels in 1994.

"The 'Akeke'e population appears to have remained relatively stable for the past 35 years, unlike many other Kaua'i endemics, which have seriously declined. Despite destructive effects of two powerful hurricanes in the past 15 years, the 'Akeke'e remains relatively common in native forests above 1,100 m elevation. Estimation of trends is complicated by the difficulty of field identification of Kaua'i forest birds, particularly when relying on vocalizations alone. Development in the Ko ke'e region, as well as continued introduction of alien plants and animals, reduces the amount of suitable habitat available. Past human activity has and continues to adversely affect the 'Akeke'e through habitat destruction, both directly through forest-clearing and logging, and indirectly through introduced pigs, goats (Capra hircus), and deer (Odocoileus hemionus); introduced mosquitoes, particularly Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus, as disease vectors, introduced birds as potential competitors and reservoirs of disease; introduced rats as nest predators; and introduced cats (Felis catus) and Barn Owls as predators on adults.

"Black Rails are impacted largely by the degradation of suitable wetland habitat. The altering of water regimes on the East coast has allowed the common reed (Phragmites australis) to invade higher sections of salt marshes and degrade Black Rail habitat. There is little baseline information to estimate population trends. Coastal populations likely declined between the 1920s and 1970s before enaction of laws protecting coastal wetlands. "
"The genus Penstemon is endemic to North America.  Of 275 species in the Penstemon genus, the blowout penstemon and only one other species are fragrant (Kottas 2008).  Blowout penstemon often is confused with shell-leaf penstemon (Penstemon grandiflorus) and narrow penstemon (Penstemon angustifolius), which also grow in the Nebraska Sandhills.  The color of narrow penstemon flowers is similar to blowout penstemon, but the size is only 1 inch long.  The flowers of shell-leaf penstemon are similar to blowout penstemon in size and color, but its leaves are spatula- or egg-shaped with the broades part above the middle.  Both the narrow and shell-leaf penstemons are common in denser vegetation along roadsides in the Sandhills, while the blowout penstemon is only found in blowouts and among very sparse vegetation (Stubbendieck et al., 1997).

"There is a lot that is still unknown about this songbird as very little formal studies were completed before the mid 80s.  Historically, the population expanded its range drastically and reached Canada in the northern limits of its range in 1917.  This expansion of geographic range peaked around 1920 and gradually declined.  Today this species is now rare or absent over most of its historic northern range as well as uncommon in most of its southern ranges (Saunders 1919, Brooks 1938, Weston 1968, Lee 1999¬). 

Populations of Bachmans Sparrow are negatively affected by fire suppression and heavy timber management in pine woods as these activities will increase the density of vegetation in the understory and altering the ecosystems characteristics that are preferred by the Sparrow.

"Jollyville Plateau salamanders respire through gills and permeable skin (Duellman and Trueb 1986, p. 217). Adult salamanders are about 2 inches (in)(5 centimeters (cm)) long (Chippindale et al. 2000, pp. 32ï¿½42).  Surface-dwelling populations of Jollyville Plateau salamanders have large, well-developed eyes; wide, yellowish heads; blunt, rounded snouts; dark greenish-brown bodies; and bright yellowish-orange tails (Chippindale et al. 2000, pp. 33ï¿½34). Some cave forms of Jollyville Plateau salamanders, which are also entirely aquatic, exhibit caveassociated morphologies, such as eye reduction, flattening of the head, and dullness or loss of color (Chippindale et al. 2000, p. 37). Genetic analysis suggests a taxonomic split within this species that appears to correspond to major geologic and topographic features of the region (Chippindale 2010, p. 2). Chippindale (2010, pp. 5, 8) concluded that the Jollyville Plateau salamander exhibits a strong genetic separation between two lineages within the species: A ï¿½ï¿½Plateauï¿½ï¿½ clade that occurs in the Bull Creek, Walnut Creek, Shoal Creek, Brushy Creek, South Brushy Creek, and southeastern Lake Travis drainages; and a ï¿½ï¿½peripheralï¿½ï¿½ clade that occurs in the Buttercup Creek and northern Lake Travis drainages (Chippindale 2010, pp. 5ï¿½8). The study also suggests this genetic separation may actually represent two species (Chippindale 2010, pp. 5, 8)."
"Jaguars in the United States are likely dispersing males from breeding populations in northern Mexico.  Movement corridors are important to maintain; however, human developments may block access to corridors or fragment contiguous habitats needed to sustain a home range.

"Green pitcher plant superficially resembles the more common yellow pitcher plant (S. flava), but the two species are not known to co-occur."
"The main reasons cited for the subspecies decline are hybridization, competition with nonnative salmonids, and overharvest.  New threats have arisen, or have become more prevalent, and these include: increased human population growth within the range of the subspecies along with potential for new water depletions; new introductions of nonnative species; fragmentation and genetic isolation of small populations; the effects of fire and firefighting with chemical retardants; and the effects of global climate change.

Additional threats are those whose impacts are limited to specific populations and do not occur at a rangewide level, and these include: the ongoing negative effects of past mining operations on water quality; the impacts of grazing, logging, and road and trail construction and use on riparian habitat and streambanks, causing increased erosion, sediment deposition, and in turn elevated water temperatures and higher turbidity; and the co-occurrence of nonnative salmonids with greenback populations.
