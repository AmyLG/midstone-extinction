Despite destructive effects of two powerful hurricanes in the past 15 years, the 'Akeke'e remains relatively common in native forests above 1,100 m elevation. Estimation of trends is complicated by the difficulty of field identification of Kaua'i forest birds, particularly when relying on vocalizations alone. Development in the Ko ke'e region, as well as continued introduction of alien plants and animals, reduces the amount of suitable habitat available. Past human activity has and continues to adversely affect the 'Akeke'e through habitat destruction, both directly through forest-clearing and logging, and indirectly through introduced pigs, goats (Capra hircus), and deer (Odocoileus hemionus); introduced mosquitoes, particularly Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus, as disease vectors, introduced birds as potential competitors and reservoirs of disease; introduced rats as nest predators; and introduced cats (Felis catus) and Barn Owls as predators on adults.

Throughout the Arctic, polar bears are known by a variety of common names,
including nanook, nanuq, ice bear, sea bear, isbjorn, white bears, and beliy medved.
Genetic research has confirmed that polar bears evolved from grizzly (brown)
bears (Ursus arctos) 250 to 300 thousand years ago (Cronin et al. 1991, p. 2990;
Talbot and Shields 1996a, p. 574). Only in portions of northern Canada and
northern Alaska do the ranges of polar bears and grizzly bears overlap.  Polar bears are the largest of the living bear species.  Polar bears are carnivorous and an upper level predator of the Arctic marine ecosystem. Polar bears prey heavily throughout their range on ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and, to a lesser extent, bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and in some locales, other seal species.
Polar bears are characterized by a late age at sexual maturity, small litter sizes, and extended parental investment in raising young, factors that combine to contribute to a very low reproductive rate. Reproduction in the female polar
bear is similar to that in other ursids (bears). Females generally mature and breed for the first time at 4 or 5 years and give birth at 5 or 6 years of age. Litters of two cubs are most common, but litters of three cubs are seen sporadically across the Arctic.",200

Conservation of Penland penstemon must include these pollinators.","The Kremmling beardtongue (also known as the Penland beardtongue) is a herbaceous (non-woody) plant species in the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) (formerly in the figwort family).  It is a compact, clumping plant with straight and pointed dark green, inrolled leaves.  The plant grows 2 to 6 inches tall and up to 8 inches wide from a spreading and deep root system, which secures the plant in the highly erodible soils of its habitat.  Its flowers are blue-violet and tubular, measuring 3/4 inch long.  In June and July you can find the showy Kremmling beardtongue in bloom.  
The Kremmling beardtongue is endemic to Middle Park in Grand County of northern Colorado, near the town of Kremmling.  Middle Park is a high elevation sagebrush valley at 7,500 feet nestled within the Rocky Mountains.  The Kremmling beardtongue is only known to occur on white to tan barren shale soil exposures.  There is only one population of the Kremmling beardtongue in the whole world making the Kremmling beard-tongue a local treasure.
The Kremmling beardtongue is threatened by off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation, road maintenance, fugitive dust from nearby roads, and utility maintenance.  The species extremely small range and limited habitat availability make it more susceptible to extinction than other species with broader ranges.  Therefore, protection of existing populations is vital to the survival of the species.  Additional threats include climate change and nonnative invasive plant (weeds).  Protection of native bee pollinators and their nesting habitat is also essential to the Kremmling beardtongues survival.

Mosquito Range mustard reproduces only by seed, with no means of vegetative reproduction (spread by vegetative growth).  Little is known about reproduction, pollinators, or seed dispersal.","Mosquito Range mustard (also known as Penland alpine fen mustard) is a small perennial plant species in the mustard family. Though the mustard family itself is large, Mosquito Range mustard is one of only two species within its genus (Eutrema) found in North America. During June through August, Mosquito Range mustard can be seen blooming; the clusters of white, four petalled flowers topping each stem. Leaves are shiny and oval along the stem but shovel-shaped at the base of the plant. Plant height ranges from 1/2 to 6 inches. Mosquito Range mustard was first collected near Hoosier Pass in 1935 by C. William T. Penland, a professor of botany at Colorado College. The species occurs only in alpine meadows at elevations above 11,800 feet in the Mosquito Range of the Rocky Mountains in central Colorado. Plants are most often found along east facing, gentle slopes and basins that are fed moisture by slow-melting snowfields above. However, they can also be found in dryer locations. In either habitat, they are often rooted in tufts of mosses or hidden among short-bladed grasses. This harsh alpine environment is also home to many other rare plant species known only to the Rocky Mountains. Mosquito Range mustard is threatened by activities that damage its sensitive habitat or alter local hydrology. Because of the Mosquito Ranges spectacular views and scenery, it is a draw for recreation, especially in the summer months. Recreation activities such as off-road vehicle use (including winter travel), camping, hiking, and roads could pose a threat to Mosquito Range mustard and its habitat. Land development, including mining, may also have an impact on the species. In addition, we do not fully understand how climate change will affect the species or the habitat in which it resides. These factors make it difficult to predict the effects of climate change to the Mosquito Range mustard. However, given that the species already resides at elevation extremes where there is nowhere to migrate higher, and given that the species is dependent on snowmelt and wet conditions, we expect that the Mosquito Range mustard is vulnerable to anticipated trends.",200

Behnke (1987) goes on to say that, food requirements are not a limitation factor for the preservation of Paiute cutthroat trout or for their successful establishment in a new environment.  This opportunistic behavior is demonstrated by the fact that Paiute cutthroat trout populations, outside their historical range, survive on prey resources that are present in streams and riparian areas.","Paiute cutthroat trout habitat requirements appear to be similar to those reported for other western stream-dwelling salmonids (Hickman and Raleigh 1982).  All life stages require cool, well-oxygenated waters.  Adult fish prefer stream pool habitat in low gradient meadows with undercut or overhanging banks and abundant riparian vegetation (Behnke and Zarn 1976).  Pools are important rearing habitat for juveniles and act as refuge areas during winter (Hickman and Raleigh 1982; Swales et al. 1986; Berg 1994).  During the winter months, trout move into pools to avoid physical damage from ice scouring (Scrimgeour et al. 1994) and to conserve energy (Everest and Chapman 1972; Cunjak 1996).  As with other salmonids, suitable winter habitat may be more restrictive than summer habitat (Jakober et al. 1998).  Paiute cutthroat trout survive in lakes, but there is no evidence that they ever occurred naturally in any lakes within the Silver King basin. Paiute cutthroat trout demonstrate fluvial spawning behavior and must have access to flowing waters with clean gravel substrates.","The Paiute cutthroat trout is known from drainages in the Sierra Nevada range in east-central California.  The presumed historic distribution was limited to 14.7 kilometers (km) [9.1 miles (mi)] of habitat in Silver King Creek (Alpine County) from Llewellyn Falls downstream to barriers in Silver King Canyon as well as the accessible reaches of three small named tributaries: Tamarack Creek, Tamarack Lake Creek, and the lower reaches of Coyote Valley Creek downstream of barrier falls (Figure 1) (Service 2004).  Paiute cutthroat trout now occupy approximately 33.2 km (20.6 mi) of habitat in five widely distributed drainages outside of their historic range.  Paiute cutthroat trout currently do not occupy any habitat within their historical range.  ",No information available,"Paiute cutthroat trout reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 years. Peak spawning activity occurs in June and July (Wong 1975). The eggs hatch in 6 to 8 weeks and the fry emerge from the gravel in another two to three weeks. Young-of-the-year fish rear in mainstem shoals or backwaters, and often move into intermittent tributary streams until they reach about 50 mm in length (Diana and Lane 1978)","The Paiute cutthroat trout is a distinctive member of the cutthroat trout complex, distinguishable from other cutthroat trouts by body coloration and the absence, or near absence, of body spots.  Snyder (1933, 1934) described these fish as a new species, (Salmo seleniris), based on: 1) absence of body spots; 2) slender body form; 3) relatively small scales; and 4) vivid coloration. Subsequent comparisons of the type specimens with other cutthroat subspecies (Ryan and Nicola 1976, Behnke 1980) revealed that the meristic and morphometric characters for Paiute cutthroat trout are also typical of those characterizing Lahontan cutthroat trout.  Behnke and Zarn (1976) concluded, on the basis of gillraker comparisons, that the separation of Paiute cutthroat from Lahontan cutthroat occurred relatively recently, (no more than 5,000 to 8,000 years ago), following the desiccation of Lake Lahontan.  Paiute cutthroat trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout both typically possess 150-180 lateral series scales, 60-63 total vertebrae, 50-70 pyloric caeca, and 21-27 gill rakers.  ",200

In a hatchery environment, exogenously feeding fry (fry that have absorbed their yolk and are actively feeding) will readily consume brine shrimp suggesting zooplankton and/or small invertebrates are likely the food base for this age group.  Data available for age-0 Scaphirhynchus indicate mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and midge (Chironomidae) larvae are important (Sechler et al. 2012).

Juvenile and adult pallid sturgeon diets are generally composed of fish and aquatic insect larvae with a trend toward piscivory as they increase in size (Carlson and Pflieger 1981; Hoover et al. 2007; Gerrity et al. 2006; Grohs et al. 2009; Wanner 2006; French 2010).   

Based on the above diet data and habitat utilization by prey items, it appears that pallid sturgeon will feed over a variety of substrates (Hoover et al. 2007; Keevin et al. 2007).  However, the abundance of Trichoptera in the diet suggests that harder substrates like gravel and rock material may be important feeding areas (Hoover et al. 2007). 
","Pallid sturgeon are a bottom-oriented, large river obligate fish inhabiting the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and some tributaries from Montana to Louisiana (Kallemeyn 1983).  Pallid sturgeon evolved in the diverse environments of the Missouri and Mississippi river systems.  Floodplains, backwaters, chutes, sloughs, islands, sandbars, and main channel waters formed the large-river ecosystem that met the habitat and life history requirements of pallid sturgeon and other native large-river fishes.  

Substrate
Pallid sturgeon have been documented over a variety of available substrates, but are often associated with sandy and fine bottom materials (Bramblett and White 2001; Elliott et al. 2004; Gerrity 2005; Snook et al. 2002; Swigle 2003; Peters and Parham 2008; Spindler 2008).  Substrate association appears to be seasonal (Kochet al. 2006a; Koch et al. 2012).  During winter and spring, a mixture of sand, gravel and rock substrates are used and during the summer and fall, sand substrate is most often used (Koch et al. 2006a).  In the middle Mississippi River, pallid sturgeon transition from predominantly sandy substrates to gravel during May which may be associated with spawning (Koch et al. 2012).  In these river systems and others, pallid sturgeon appear to use underwater sand dunes (Bramblett 1996; Constant et al. 1997; Snook et al. 2002; Elliott et al. 2004; Jordan et al. 2006).  

Depths and Velocity
Across their range, pallid sturgeon have been documented in waters of varying depths and velocities.  Depths at collection sites range from 0.58 meter (m) to > 20 m (1.9 to > 65 feet (ft)), though there may be selection for areas at least 0.8 m (2.6 ft) deep (Bramblett and White 2001; Carlson and Pflieger 1981; Constant et al. 1997; Erickson 1992; Gerrity 2005; Jordan et al. 2006; Peters and Parham 2008; Wanner et al. 2007).  Despite the wide range of depths associated with capture locations, one commonality is apparent: this species is typically found in areas where relative depths (the depth at the fish location divided by the maximum channel cross section depth expressed as a percent) exceed 75% (Constant et al. 1997; Gerrity 2005; Jordan et al. 2006; Wanner et al. 2007).

Bottom water velocities associated with collection locations are generally < 1.5 m/s (4.9 ft/s) with reported averages ranging from 0.58 m/s to 0.88 m/s (1.9 ft/s to 2.9 ft/s) (Carlson and Pflieger 1981; Elliott et al. 2004; Erickson 1992; Jordan et al. 2006; Swigle 2003; Snook et al. 2002). 
",No information available,No information available,"Pallid sturgeon can be long-lived, with females reaching sexual maturity later than males (Keenlyne and Jenkins 1993).  Based on wild fish, estimated age at first reproduction was 15 to 20 years for females and approximately 5 years for males (Keenlyne and Jenkins 1993).  Like most fish species, water temperatures influence growth and maturity. Female hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon maintained in an artificially controlled environment (i.e., near constant 16 to 20oC temperatures) can attain sexual maturity at age 6, whereas female pallid sturgeon subject to colder winter water temperatures reached maturity around age 9 (Webb in litt., 2011). Thus, age at first reproduction likely is variable and dependent on local conditions.  

Females do not spawn each year (Kallemeyn 1983).  Observations of wild pallid sturgeon collected as part of the conservation stocking program in the northern part of the range indicates that female spawning periodicity is 2-3 years (Rob Holm, USFWS Garrison Dam Hatchery, unpublished data).  

Fecundity is related to body size. The largest upper Missouri River fish can produce as many as 150,000-170,000 eggs (Keenlyne et al. 1992; Rob Holm, USFWS Garrison Dam Hatchery, unpublished data), whereas smaller bodied females in the southern extent of the range may only produce 43,000-58,000 eggs (George et al. 2012).  Spawning appears to occur between March and July, with lower latitude fish spawning earlier than those in the northern portion of the range.  Adult pallid sturgeon can move long distances upstream prior to spawning, and females likely are spawning at or near the apex of these movements (Bramblett and White 2001; DeLonay et al. 2009).  This behavior can be associated with spawning migrations (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 2007; DeLonay et al. 2009).  Spawning appears to occur over firm substrates, in deeper water, with relatively fast, turbulent flows, and is driven by several environmental stimuli including flow, water temperature, and day length (USGS 2007; DeLonay et al. 2009).  

Incubation rates are governed by and depend upon water temperature.  In a hatchery environment, fertilized eggs hatch in approximately 5-7 days (Keenlyne 1995).  Incubation rates may deviate slightly from this in the wild.  Newly hatched larvae are predominantly pelagic, drifting in the currents for 11 to 13 days and dispersing several hundred km downstream from spawn and hatch locations (Kynard et al. 2002, 2007; Braaten et al. 2008, 2010, 2012a).  ","The pallid sturgeon was first recognized as a species different from shovelnose sturgeon by S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson in 1905 based on a study of nine specimens collected from the Mississippi River near Grafton, Illinois (Forbes and Richardson 1905). They named this new species Parascaphirhynchus albus.  Later reclassification assigned it to the genus Scaphirhynchus where it has remained (Bailey and Cross 1954; Campton et al. 2000).

Pallid sturgeon have a flattened shovel-shaped snout; a long, slender, and completely armored caudal peduncle (the tapered portion of the body which terminates at the tail); and lack a spiracle (small openings found on each side of the head) (Forbes and Richardson 1905).  As with other sturgeon, the mouth is toothless, protrusible (capable of being extended and withdrawn from its natural position), and ventrally positioned under the head.  The skeletal structure is primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone. ",200

Many of the characteristics that are most similar among sites promote continual shifting of the substrate:  steep slopes, unstable surface layers of broken shale rubble, and no surface soil.  The plants grow on steep, oil shale outcrop slopes of white shale talus at 8,000 to 9,000 ft (2,400 to 2,700 m) in elevation on the southern escarpment of the Roan Plateau above the Colorado River and the town of Parachute, Colorado.  The Roan Plateau falls into the geologic structural basin known as the Piceance Basin.  Average annual precipitation at Parachute, Colorado, is 12.75 in (32.4 cm), which is considered a high desert climate. Parachute beardtongue is found only on the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation.  Parachute beardtongue is often found growing with other species endemic to the Green River formation, including Mentzelia rhizomata (Roan Cliffs blazingstar), Astragalus lutosus (dragon milkvetch), Festuca dasyclada (Utah fescue), and Thalictrum heliophilum (sun-loving meadowrue), as well as several non-endemics.","The historical range and distribution for this species is unknown.  All of the currently known occurrences occupy about 91.8 ac (37.2 ha) on the Green River geologic formation in Garfield County, Colorado.  Although this formation is underground throughout most of the Piceance Basin, it is exposed on much of the southern face of the Roan Plateau, to which the plant is restricted.  The total area of the plants geographic range is about 2 mi (3 km) wide and 17 mi (27 km) long.  Six occurrences of Parachute beardtongue were found between 1986 and 2005; two of them are no longer viable.  It is likely that unknown occurrences exist, because many areas are inaccessible to surveyors due to cliff-side terrain or private land ownership or both.  ",No information available,"Parachute beardtongue plants require cross pollination, and have many different pollinators that vary between occurrences.  None of the pollinators are specialists to Parachute beardtongue, nor are any of them rare.  ","Parachute beardtongue was discovered in 1986, and was first described by OKane and Anderson in 1987.  Parachute beardtongue is a mat-forming perennial herb with thick, succulent, bluish leaves, each about 0.8 in. (2 cm) long and 0.4 in. (1 cm) wide.  Plants produce shoots that run along underground, forming what appear as new plants at short distances away.  Individual Parachute beardtongue plants are able to survive on the steep, unstable, shale slopes by responding with stem elongation as leaves are buried by the shifting talus.  Buried stems progressively elongate down slope from the initial point of rooting to a surface sufficiently stable to allow the development of a tuft of leaves and flowers.  The funnel-shaped flowers are white to pale lavender, and bloom during June and July.  Parachute beardtongue plants produce a small number of seeds that are dispersed by gravity.

The musk thistle (Carduus nutans) is important along river bottoms and up some ravines.  Female skippers have been observed in large numbers on musk thistle along the South Platte River canyon bottom.  ","Skippers occur in dry, open, ponderosa pine woodlands on moderately steep slopes with soils derived from Pikes Peak granite.  The understory is very sparse in the pine woodlands.  Blue grama grass, the larval food plant, and prairie gayfeather, the primary nectar plant, are two necessary components of the groundcover strata.  Small clumps of blue grama occur throughout the hot, open slopes inhabited by skippers.  Prairie gayfeather occurs throughout the ponderosa pine woodlands.  Skippers are very uncommon in pine woodlands with a tall shrub understory or where young conifers dominate the understory.

A quantitative estimate of optimum skipper habitat characteristics includes: tree canopy cover of 30 percent with ponderosa pine cover of 25 percent and Douglas-fir of 5 percent; tree density of less than 120 trees/acre in the smallest size class (0-5 inches diameter breast high) and overall tree density of less than 200 trees/acre; shrub and grass cover generally less than 10 percent; prairie gayfeather flowering stem density ranging from 50 to 500 flowering stems/acre; and blue grama canopy cover of 1 to 5 percent.  The limiting habitat endpoints for the skipper seem to be treeless areas of 5 acres or more at one extreme to woodlands with understory shrub cover of 25 percent or more at the other extreme.  The skipper is largely absent from steep, north-facing Douglas-fir stands where neither prairie gayfeather nor blue grama are plentiful.

Prairie gayfeather seems to require openings from single event disturbance such as logging or fire-created habitat, but does not tolerate continuous disturbance.  However, it appears that the skipper does not colonize such areas for at least several years after disturbance and regeneration.  Burnt or logged areas surveyed in 1986 had low numbers of skippers.
","
The skipper has a restricted range, occupying an area (though not necessarily all the available habitat within it) roughly 23 miles long and 5 miles wide.  It occurs along the mainstem of the South Platte River for approximately 20 miles and the North Fork of the South Platte River for approximately 15 miles upstream from their confluence with Cheesman Reservoir and Crossons, respectively.  Currently, the skippers habitat forms one continuous band along the North and South Forks of the South Platte River and includes two of their tributaries, Buffalo and Horse creeks, respectively.  This type of habitat configuration allows for an interchange of individuals throughout the habitat.

The plant community preferred by the skipper is the northern-most extension of the ponderosa pine/blue grama grass habitat type documented from southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.  However, the preferred nectar plant of the skipper, prairie gayfeather does not occur in similar habitats to the south.  The northeastern limits of the ponderosa pine/blue grama grass community overlapping with the southwestern limit of the prairie gayfeather may contribute to the maintenance of the species in this limited area.
The elevational range of the species is 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  Studies in 1985 showed that the ratio of males to female skippers was much greater at higher elevations than at lower elevations (32 males/7 females above 7,100 feet and 34 males/20 females below 7,100 feet).
","There are two other subspecies of this group:  Hesperia leonardus leonardus occurs in the eastern United States and Canada, and Hesperia leonardus pawnee occurs on the Northern Great Plains.  The presence of ventral hind wing spots and its darker color differentiates Hesperia leonardus montana from Hesperia leonardus pawnee.

Since modern settlement of Colorado, the Platte River Canyon has experienced a number of habitat changes that likely have resulted in loss, modification, and curtailment of former skipper habitat and range.  Habitat loss likely has occurred as a result of fire suppression over the last 120 years.  The encroachment of conifers and the subsequent loss of grasses and prairie gayfeather have reduced the quality and quantity of skipper habitat.  Causes of lost habitat include Cheesman Reservoir, catastrophic fire, residential development, roads, and planted and mowed pastures.  Invasion of noxious weeds, such as knapweed, which may outcompete blue grama and prairie gayfeather are also a serious threat to the skipper. 
","Pawnee montane skippers emerge as adult butterflies as early as late July.  Males emerge before females by an average of a week to 10 days.  The adults spend most of their short existence feeding and mating.  Adult females directly deposit eggs singly on leaves of blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis), the larval food plant.  The species overwinters as larvae, and little is known of the larval and pupal stages.  Pupation is generally short (13-23 days), as in most butterflies.  The species completes its life cycle (egg to larva to pupa to adult butterfly to egg) annually.  Adults probably fly until a major killing frost occurs.  Additionally, the phenology of prairie gayfeather (Liatris punctata), the primary nectar plant, and the presence of the skipper are highly synchronous. ","The skipper, a member of the Hesperidae butterfly family, was first described in 1911 as Pamphila (Hesperia) pawnee montana.  In 1982, two species (Hesperia pawnee and Hesperia leonardus) were combined, retaining the specific name leonardus, and treating the Pawnee montane skipper as Hesperia leonardus montana.  The subspecies occurs only in the South Platte Canyon River drainage system in Colorado, in portions of Jefferson, Douglas, Teller, and Park Counties.

The Pawnee montane skipper is a small, brownish-yellow butterfly with a wing span slightly over 1 inch.  Small, fulvous (dull brownish-yellow), usually distinct spots occur near the outer margins of the upper surface of the wings, while one to four distinct brownish to off-white spots occur on the lower (ventral) surface of the wings.  The ventral spots are larger on the hind wing and are generally whiter on the female butterfly.

These analyses indicate that the diet of the Prebles jumping mouse shifts seasonally; it consists primarily of insects and fungi after emerging from hibernation in May, shifts to fungi, moss, and pollen during mid-summer (July and August), with insects again added in September. The shift in diet along with shifts in mouse movements suggests that the PMJM may require specific seasonal diets, perhaps related to the physiological constraints imposed by hibernation.  It is likely that seeds also compose a significant part of the diet and PMJM have been observed climbing grass stalks to forage on the seed heads.","Prebles meadow jumping mouse inhabits well developed riparian habitat with adjacent, relatively undisturbed grassland communities, and a nearby water source.  Well developed riparian habitat includes a dense combination of grasses, forbs and shrubs; a taller shrub and tree canopy may be present.  PMJM has been found to regularly use uplands at least as far out as 100 meters beyond the 100-year flood plain. 

The PMJM constructs day nests composed of grasses, forbs, sedges, rushes, and other available plant material. They may be globular in shape or simply raised mats of litter and are most commonly above ground but also can be below ground. Nests are typically found under debris at the base of shrubs and trees or in open grasslands.  An individual mouse can have multiple day nests in both riparian and grassland communities and may abandon a nest after approximately a week of use.  Hibernation nests occur underground both within and outside of the 100-year floodplain.  Hibernacula have been located under willow, chokecherry, snowberry, skunkbrush, sumac, clematis, cottonwoods, Gambels oak, thistle, and alyssum.

PMJM typically enter hibernation nests between September and October and emerge the following May.  The PMJM does not store food, but survives on fat stores accumulated prior to hibernation.  
","Dispersal by Prebles meadow jumping mouse is thought to be limited; the farthest movement by an individual that has been documented was 0.7 miles within a 24-hour period.  However, the PMJM is able to move miles along stream corridors over its lifetime.","Habitat loss, alteration, degradation, and fragmentation resulting from urban development, flood control, water development and other human land uses, especially in riparian habitat, have adversely impacted PMJM populations. ","The Preble's meadow jumping mouse usually has two litters per year, with an average of five young born per litter.  Prebles are long-lived for a small mammal, in comparison with many species of mice and voles that seldom live a full year.  Along South Boulder Creek, Boulder County, Colorado, seven individuals originally captured as adults were still alive two years later, having attained at least three years of age.","The Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Preble's or PMJM) is a small mammal approximately 9 inches in length with large hind feet adapted for jumping, a long bicolored tail (which accounts for 60% of its length), and a distinct dark stripe down the middle of its back which is bordered on either side by gray to orange-brown fur.  To evade predators, the mouse can jump up to three feet.

Diets shift from animals to a variety of seeds as the active season progresses (Trainor et al. 2012, p. 435; Frey 2013e, p. 9).  Based on studies of other species, jumping mice (Zapus spp.) diets are varied, consisting of seeds, insects, fruits, and fungi (Quimby 1951, pp. 8586; Hoffmeister 1986, p. 455; Morrison 1990, p. 141).  Morrison (1990, p. 141) reported that jumping mice feed primarily on seeds of grasses and forbs, with seeds of sedges, bulrush (Scirpus spp.), and cattail (Typha latifolia) infrequently eaten.  Frey and Wright (2010, p. 20; 2012, p. 28; Wright and Frey 2014, entire) observed radio-collared jumping mice on Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), adjacent to the middle Rio Grande in New Mexico, feeding on the ground and in the herbaceous canopy 0.5 to 1 m (1.6 to 3.3 ft) or more above the ground eating common threesquare (Schoenoplectus pungens), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), Saunders wildrye (Elymus saundersii), Japanese brome (Bromus japonicas), slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus), and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) ","1.  Riparian communities along rivers and streams, springs and wetlands, or canals and ditches that contain: 

2.  persistent emergent herbaceous wetlands especially characterized by presence of primarily forbs and sedges (Carex spp. or Schoenoplectus pungens); or 

3.  Scrub-shrub riparian areas that are composed of willows (Salix spp.) or alders (Alnus spp.) with an understory of primarily forbs and sedges; and

4.  Flowing water that provides saturated soils throughout the New Mexico meadow jumping mouses active season that supports:

5.  Tall (average stubble height of herbaceous vegetation of at least 61 cm (24 inches) and dense herbaceous riparian vegetation composed primarily of sedges (Carex spp. or Schoenoplectus pungens) and forbs, including, but not limited to one or more of the following associated species: spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), beaked sedge (Carex rostrata), rushes (Juncus spp. and Scirpus spp.), and numerous species of grasses such as bluegrass (Poa spp.), slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus), brome (Bromus spp.), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), or Japanese brome (Bromus japonicas), and forbs such as water hemlock (Circuta douglasii), field mint (Mentha arvense), asters (Aster spp.), or cutleaf coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata); and

6.  Sufficient areas of 9 to 24 km (5.6 to 15 mi) along a stream, ditch, or canal that contains suitable or restorable habitat to support movements of individual New Mexico meadow jumping mice; and

7.  Include adjacent floodplain and upland areas extending approximately 100 m (330 ft) outward from the boundary between the active water channel and the floodplain (as defined by the bankfull stage of streams) or from the top edge of the ditch or canal.
","New Mexico meadow jumping mice are generally believed to have limited vagility (ability to move) and possibly dispersal capabilities (Morrison 1988, p. 13; Frey and Wright 2012, pp. 43, 109).  For example, on Bosque del Apache NWR, the subspecies exhibited extreme site fidelity for daily activities (i.e., movements to and from day nesting and feeding areas) (Frey and Wright 2012, p. 24).  Frey and Wright (2012, pp. 12, 15) reported that the typical maximum distance travelled between successive telemetry locations by jumping mice on Bosque del Apache NWR was 300 m (984 ft).  In addition, most daily movements based on 95 percent of maximum straight-line distances traveled between time-independent radio telemetry locations (i.e., sufficient time has elapsed to allow the animals to redistribute throughout the home range) were 192 m (630 ft) or less.  Moreover, the maximum distance travelled between two successive points by all radio collared New Mexico meadow jumping mice on Bosque del Apache NWR was 744 m (2,441 ft), but most regular daily and seasonal movements were less than 100 m (328 ft) (Frey and Wright 2012, pp. 16, 109; Figure 9).  One New Mexico meadow jumping mouse also moved up 1 km (3,280 ft) between years (Frey and Wright 2012, p. 33, 95-96); however, it is unclear how frequently jumping mice are undergoing these long-distance (> 1 km (0.6 mi)) movements.  

, Frey and Wright (2012, pp. 23, 54) fitted 20 jumping mice on Bosque del Apache NWR with radio collars to evaluate habitat selection.  The estimated home range size averaged 1.37 ha (3.4 ac) (range = 0.2 to 4.15 ha (0.5 to 10.25 ac)).  Typically, male home ranges (average = 1.77 ha (4.37 ac)) were larger than those of females (0.88 ha (2.17 ac)) (Frey and Wright 2012, p. 23).  Beyond these data, very little is known about specific movements of the New Mexico meadow jumping mice. ",No information available,"Although little is known about the reproductive needs of the jumping mouse, the breeding season probably begins in July or August, with one litter produced each year (Morrison 1987, pp. 1415; 1989, 22; Frey 2011, p. 69; 2012b, p. 5).  Jumping mice (Zapus spp.) breed shortly after emerging from hibernation and may give birth to 2 to 7 young after an average 17 to 21 day gestation (Quimby 1951, p. 63; Frey 2011, p. 69).  Young are fully developed and weaned at 4 weeks after birth (Morrison 1987, p. 16; Van Pelt 1993, p. 8).  Females will use maternal nests (described below) in areas outside the moist riparian areas for giving birth and rearing young.  Tall, dense riparian herbaceous vegetation provides the jumping mouse with a sheltered and hospitable environment, with adequate food resources that enables the mouse to successfully raise its young.  The female provides all the care for their young until they are weaned and independent.  It is unlikely that juveniles breed during the same year they are born (Morrison 1988, p. 9).  ","The New Mexico meadow jumping mouse (jumping mouse) is endemic to New Mexico, Arizona, and a small area of southern Colorado (Hafner et al. 1981, pp. 501-502; Jones 1999, p. 1). The jumping mouse is grayish-brown on the back, yellowish-brown on the sides, and white underneath (Van Pelt 1993, p 1).  The species is about 7. 4 to 10 inches (187 to 255 mm) in total length, with elongated feet (1.2 inches (30.6 mm)) and an extremely long, bicolored tail (5.1 inches (130.6 mm)) (Van Pelt 1993, p. 1; Hafner et al. 1981, p. 509).  The jumping mouse is a habitat specialist (Frey 2006d, p. 3).  It nests in dry soils, but uses moist, streamside, dense riparian/wetland vegetation up to an elevation of about 8,000 feet (Frey 2006d, pp. 34-45).  The jumping mouse appears to only utilize two riparian community types:  1) persistent emergent herbaceous wetlands (i.e., beaked sedge and reed canarygrass alliances); and 2) scrub-shrub wetlands (i.e., riparian areas along perennial streams that are composed of willows and alders) (Frey 2005, p. 53).  It especially uses microhabitats of patches or stringers of tall dense sedges on moist soil along the edge of permanent water. Home ranges vary between 0.37 and 2.7 acres (0.15 and 1.1 hectares) and may overlap (Smith 1999, p. 4).  
The jumping mouse is generally nocturnal, but occasionally diurnal.  It is active only during the growing season of the grasses and forbs on which it depends.  During the growing season, the jumping mouse accumulates fat reserves by consuming seeds.  Preparation for hibernation (weight gain, nest building) seems to be triggered by day length.  The jumping mouse hibernates about 9 months out of the year, longer than most other mammals (Morrison 1990, p. 141; VanPelt 1993, p. 1; Frey 2005a, p. 59).

Studies have shown the beetles to be depended on medium to medium coarse sand with low organics.  Adult beetles are present from June through September and are active on warm, sunny days where they can be seen feeding, mating, or basking along the water's edge.","Once abundant along coastal beaches from Massachusetts to New Jersey, and along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia.  The Northeastern beach tiger beetle has been extirpated from Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York.  The status of the translocated population at Gateway National Recreation Area, Sandy Hook, New Jersey is uncertain.  Only two known populations of this beetle can be found north of the Chesapeake Bay, both in Massachusetts (Marthas Vineyard and a translocation population at Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge).  There is only four sites remaining in Maryland, and the highest number of populated sites are located along sections of beaches found in Virginia's portion of the Chesapeake Bay. Studies have shown that adults can disperse up to 7 kilometers after emergence.","Few northeastern beach tiger beetle sites are protected and many are threatened by human activities.  Loss of this beetle from most of its range has been attributed primarily to destruction and disturbance of natural beach habitat from shoreline development, beach stabilization, and high levels of recreational use.  Additional threats include pollution, pesticides, oil slicks, and off-road vehicle traffic.  Natural limiting factors include winter storms, beach erosion, flood tides, hurricanes, parasites, and predators.","Adults are primarily active from June to September, and over winters as larvae. The adults mate and lay eggs from late June through August. Females are thought to lay eggs at night in shallow burrows in the mid to high tide zone on coastal beaches. Burrows are 15-50 cm deep and are found anywhere from just above mean low tide line to the base of the dunes above the beach. The larvae will move their burrows up the beach to avoid winter storm floods and narrowing of the beach. Larvae are active primarily at night and plug the entrance to their burrow during warm days when the sand surface dries out. Depending on the prey base availability, the larvae will transition through three stages in one to two years before they pupate and emerge as adults. The larvae are present year round on the beach, hibernating through the winter.","The largest (13-15 mm) of the recognized subspecies, the Northeastern beach tiger beetle is bronze to greenish with extensive maculations that run the length of the elytra. The maculations are wide, cream-colored, and frequently are expanded to cover much of the elytral surface. Abrasion by sand makes elytra of older individuals lighter. Below it is dark bronze to dark green with dense, white hair-like setae covering the sides of the abdomen. The last pair of legs is exceptionally long. The males and females are visibly different in the shape of the thorax (cylindrical in males, trapezoidal in females), and the shape of the elytral tip (rounded in males, broadly notched in females).",200

This bat also feeds by gleaning motionless insects from vegetation and water surfaces. ","During summer, northern long-eared bats roost singly or in colonies underneath bark, in cavities, or in crevices of both live and dead trees. Males and non-reproductive females may also roost in cooler places, like caves and mines. This bat seems opportunistic in selecting roosts, using tree species based on suitability to retain bark or provide cavities or crevices. It has also been found, rarely, roosting in structures like barns and sheds. 

Northern long-eared bats spend winter hibernating in caves and mines, called hibernacula. They typically use large caves or mines with large passages and entrances; constant temperatures; and high humidity with no air currents. Specific areas where they hibernate have very high humidity, so much so that droplets of water are often seen on their fur. Within hibernacula, surveyors find them in small crevices or cracks, often with only the nose and ears visible.",No information available,No information available,"Breeding begins in late summer or early fall when males begin swarming near hibernacula. After copulation, females store sperm during hibernation until spring, when they emerge from their hibernacula, ovulate, and the stored sperm fertilizes an egg. This strategy is called delayed fertilization.

After fertilization, pregnant females migrate to summer areas where they roost in small colonies and give birth to a single pup. Maternity colonies, with young, generally have 30 to 60 bats, although larger maternity colonies have been observed. Most females within a maternity colony give birth around the same time, which may occur from late May or early June to late July, depending where the colony is located within the species range. Young bats start flying by 18 to 21 days after birth. Adult northern long-eared bats can live up to 19 years.
","The northern long-eared bat is a medium-sized bat about 3 to 3.7 inches in length but with a wingspan of 9 to 10 inches. As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The species range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared bats entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.  ",200

It has many slender and erect stems that grow to, on average, 12 to 40 inches tall.  Its leaves are made up of many narrow leaflets each up to 1 1/2 inches long.  In summer, the Kremmling Osterhout milkvetchs creamy white flowers bloom, hanging along the end of each flowering stalk.  In fall, its long, green fruits often turn maroon red when mature.  Though distinctive, the Kremmling Osterhout milkvetch may be confused with other milkvetch species in the area.

The Kremmling Osterhout milkvetch was first collected by George Osterhout, a Colorado botanist, in 1905.  The species is known only to a 15 mile range near the town of Kremmling in Middle Park of northern Colorado, a high elevation sagebrush valley surrounded by ranges of the Rocky Mountains.  The Kremmling Osterhout milkvetch grows in five scattered populations on barren shale soils.  These soils are rich in selenium, which the Kremmling Osterhout milkvetch concentrates in its tissues giving the plants a distinctive garlic-like odor. 

The Kremmling Osterhout milkvetch is threatened by off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation, road and utility construction and maintenance, mining, oil and gas exploration, concentrated livestock  use, land development, and other land uses occurring within the species habitat.  Some plants were lost when Wolford Dam was constructed.  Additional threats include climate change and nonnative invasive plants (weeds). Due to its limited range and few numbers, its vulnerability to habitat modification and loss is high.  Therefore, protection of existing populations is vital to the survival of the species.

Mussels have been reported to consume detritus, diatoms, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and other microorganisms (Coker et al. 1921, Churchill and Lewis 1924, Fuller 1974). According to Ukeles (1971),
phytoplankton is the principal food of bivalves. However, other food sources (e.g., bacteria, organic detritus, assimilated organic material, phagotrophic protozoans) may also play an important role (Neves et al. 1996). Churchill (1916) concluded that mussels could absorb various sources of fat, protein, and starch dissolved in the water. According to Baldwin and
Newell (1991), bivalves feed on an entire array of naturally available particles (e.g., heterotrophic bacteria, phagotrophic protozoans, phytoplankton). Based on the findings of studies such as Baldwin and Newell (1991) and Neves et al. (1996), an omnivorous opportunistic diet would
allow mussels to take advantage of whatever food type happens to be abundant.

Juvenile mussels employ foot (pedal) feeding, and are thus suspension feeders (Yeager et al. 1994). Video observations of rainbow mussel (Villosa iris [Lea, 1829]) by Yeager et al. (1994) revealed juveniles occupy the top 0.4 in (1.0 cm) of sediment and employed two types of feeding mechanisms: 1) collecting organic and inorganic particles that adhere to the foot and conveying them to the pedal valve gape with sweeping motions; and 2) extending the foot anteriorly pulling themselves along while picking up organic and inorganic particles on the foot. These methods of
suspension feeding have been termed pedal sweep feeding and pedal locomotory feeding, respectively (Reid et al. 1992).

Foods of juveniles up to two weeks old include bacteria, algae, and diatoms with amounts of detrital and inorganic colloidal particles (Yeager et al. 1994). In juvenile freshwater mussel feeding experiments, Neves et al. (1996) found that algae was a suitable food and Gatenby et al. (1997) determined that a tri-algal (three algae species) diet high in lipids mixed with fine sediment resulted in better growth. Silt provided some nutritional value, which was also observed by Hudson and Isom (1984), but bacteria in riverine sediments was not essential to growth and survival (Neves et al. 1996).","The oval pigtoe occurs in small to medium-sized creeks to small rivers where it inhabits silty sand to sand and gravel substrates, usually in slow to moderate current (Williams and Butler 1994).  Stream channels appear to offer the best habitat for this species.  The ACF Basin status survey located 85 percent of the specimens in sandy substrates associated with either detritus, or clay, or silt, or cobble (Brim Box and Williams 2000). In the Suwannee River drainage, specimens of the oval pigtoe were associated with sandy mud and coarse sand sediments with little to no detritus (Blalock-Herod 2000).",No information available,No information available,"Ortmann (1909b) considered Pleurobema species to have a short, summer breeding season (tachytictic). Gravid oval pigtoe were collected from the ACF Basin from March through July at water temperatures of 55.4 to 77.0°F (OBrien and Williams 2002). This indicates that this unionine is a summer releasing but not necessarily a parent overwintering species, as fertilization may take place in late winter or early spring. Females readily aborted their conglutinates in the laboratory, which contained both ova and glochidia in several stages of development. The structures are elongate, white to pinkish, approximately 0.2 in (0.5 cm) long, and one layer thick
(OBrien and Williams 2002). Once released, the glochidia remained viable for three days. The morphology of the glochidia was described and figured by OBrien and Williams (2002).

Fritts and Bringolf (2014) documented the successful transformation (>27%) of glochidia on six minnow species (Cyprinidae): blacktail shiner (Cyprinella venusta), bluehead chub (Nocomis leptocephalus), longjaw minnow (Notropis amplamala), yellowfin shiner (N. lutipinnis), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus).  Cyprinella venusta and Semotilus atromaculatus had the highest metamorphosis success at 58.3% and 52.7% respectively.  They found that glochidia were released as fragile pink conglutinates consistent with previous descriptions for Pleurobema (e.g. Hove and Neves 1994; Haag and Warren 1997).

","Ozark cavefish grow at a slow rate, approximately 0.6 millimeters every month, and have a long lifespan. Because they are only viable in the wild and conservation measures restrict the capture of this species, a measure of average lifespan in captivity is not available. However, the average lifespan of wild populations is approximately 10 years(Poulson, 1963).","Ozark cavefish are polygynandrous species, mating at random with multiple partners in an attempt to increase population fitness, although not all females may have ova ready for fertilization.

Ozark cavefish are considered sexually mature at age 4. Regardless of their sexual maturity, about 20% of the mature female population develop ova each year. It is believed that this reproductive limitation results from limited food sources in the cave. This birth limitation also helps to control food availability; lower population sizes do not demand as much food, which is limited in the cave environment. Eggs produced during each breeding period tend to be large in size and low in number when compared to similar species.

It has a short, narrow tail, tan feet and ears, grey-brown throat, and a creamy white eye ring. This rare squirrel needs large quantities of grass seed, stems and other green leafy vegetation to store fat reserves for its eight-month hibernation period (August/early September through late April/May). Adult males are first to emerge from burrows in the spring followed by females and their young. Populations of the northern Idaho ground squirrel have been found in Adams and Valley Counties of western Idaho, though the species historic range extends into neighboring Washington County. It occurs in dry meadows surrounded by ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests, including lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service's Payette National Forest (1,500 to 7,500-foot elevations). Today there are an estimated 1,500 to 2,200 individual animals in about 54 populations, including New Meadows, Lost Valley Reservoir, and other nearby locations. It is thought that northern Idaho ground squirrel populations have decreased due to the loss of their native meadow habitat as a result of fire suppression. Important travel corridors have become fragmented, leaving the ground squirrels to survive in isolated islands of non-connected habitat. As of 2011, the recovery status remained unclear, though range-wide monitoring shows known populations as stable to slightly increasing over time. Biologists have recorded several new population sites, and the animal seems to be responding positively to habitat restoration at certain locations, especially on the Payette National Forest.",200

Although some individuals have only five pairs of costals, in nearly all cases some division of costal scutes occurs, so that as many as six to nine pairs may be present. In addition, the vertebral scutes also show frequent division, as do the scales on the dorsal surface of the head. The prefrontal scales, however, typically number two pairs. Existing reports suggest that the olive ridley's diet includes crabs, shrimp, rock lobsters, jellyfish, and tunicates. In some parts of the world, algae has been reported as its principal food.",200

It grows on average 6 to 12 inches tall and its bright purple flowers are arranged in coils at the ends of stems.  Leaves are dark green, deeply lobed, and covered with short, coarse stiff hairs.  You can find North Park phacelia blooming in July and August.  However, the species is a biennial surviving for one year as a rosette of leaves before flowering and dying the following year. North Park phacelia was first collected in 1918 by George Osterhout, a famed botanist from Colorado. North park phacelia is found only in North Park of northern Colorados Jackson County.  The species is limited to eroded soil outcrops composed of barren exposures of the Coalmont Formation, a coal-bearing substrate. The species is found at about 8,000 to 8,300 feet in elevation. Roughly 16,000 individuals are known from six separate populations and the entire species is known only to an area measuring roughly 10 miles in 
either direction (north to south, east to west). The primary threats to North Park phacelia are concentrated livestock use (trampling), off-highway vehicle recreation, land use changes including energy development, commercial and residential development, and range improvements. Because of its extremely limited distribution, the species is vulnerable to habitat modification and changes in the environment. North Park phacelia also relies on insect pollinators to maintain genetic diversity.  The loss of pollinators and pollinator habitat is considered a threat to the species.

The life span of most aquatic snails is 9 to 15 months (Pennak 1989, p. 552); the survival of one species in the genus Pyrgulopsis in the laboratory was nearly 13 months (Lysne et al. 2007, p. 3).","Martinez and Myers (2008, pp. 189, 194) found that presence of Three Forks springsnail was associated with gravel and pebble substrates, shallow water up to 2.4 in (6 centimeters (cm)) deep, high conductivity, alkaline waters of pH 8, and the presence of pond snails (Physa gyrina). Martinez and Rogowski (2011, p. 218) found that density of Three Forks springsnail was greater in water depths less than 2.2 in (5.6 cm), where density of pond snails was less than 5.5 per square yard (4.6 per square meter), and where distance from the springhead was less than 2.6 ft (0.8 m). In captivity, the species selected water depths of 3.2 in (8.1 cm) in an aquarium that ranged from 1.9 in (4.8 cm) to 7.5 in (19.1 cm) in depth (Rogowski 2011, p. 1). It has been shown that density of Three Forks springsnail is significantly greater on gravel and cobble substrates (Martinez and Rogowski 2011, p. 220; Martinez and Myers 2002, p. 1), though the species has been reported as abundant in the fine-grained mud of a 0.03-acre (ac) (0.01-hectare (ha)) pond at Three Forks Springs (Taylor 1987, p. 32).","Historically, the Three Forks springsnail is known to have occurred in numerous springs and seeps in Apache County, Arizona. In recent years, the springnail was found only in the Three Forks Springs, Boneyard Bog Springs, and Boneyard Creek Springs. Each of these spring complexes comprise few to many spring vents and are found in shallow canyon drainage or open mountain meadows at 8,200 feet (ft) (2,500 meters (m)) in elevation.  ","Because the species is so limited in range, the magnitude of threats that are occurring now are high, and those that may impact the species in the foreseeable future are high as well.  Predation by nonnative crayfish is currently threatening the Three Forks springsnail across its entire range.  In addition to the current threats, the Three Forks springsnail is also at a high risk of extinction due to threats that could affect the species in the foreseeable future, such as the use of fire retardant chemicals during future wildfires, the potential spread and competition with New Zealand springsnails, and the potential for climate change and drought to dry its springhead habitat.","Springsnails in the genus Pyrgulopsis are egg-layers with a single small egg capsule deposited on a hard surface (Hershler 1998, p. 14; Pearson 2011, p. 3). The larval stage is completed in the egg capsule, and upon hatching, tiny snails emerge into their  adult habitat (Brusca and Brusca 1990, p. 759; Hershler and Sada 2002, p. 256). The sexes are separate, and females are noticeably larger than males. ","The Three Forks springsnail was originally described as Fontelicella trivialis by Taylor (1987, pp. 30, 32) and later Pyrgulopsis confluentis by Hershler and Landye (1988, pp. 32, 35) from a spring-fed pond at Three Forks, Apache County, Arizona. The species was renamed Pyrgulopsis trivialis by Hershler (1994, pp. 68, 69). The Three Forks springsnail is a variably sized species, with a shell height (length) of 0.06 to 0.19 inches (in) (1.5 to 4.8 millimeters (mm). A detailed description of the identifying characteristics of the Three Forks springsnail is found in Taylor (1987, pp. 30, 32), Hershler and Landye (1988, pp. 32, 35), and Hershler (1994, pp. 68, 69). Springsnails are strictly aquatic, and respiration occurs through an internal gill. Mobility is limited, and significant migration likely does not occur, although aquatic snails have been known to disperse by becoming attached to the feathers of migratory birds (Roscoe 1955, p. 66; Dundee et al. 1967, pp. 89, 90).",200

Groundwater seepage with lateral groundwater movement are common hydrologic characteristics of swamp pink habitat.

Swamp pink is a shade-tolerant plant and has been found in wetlands with canopy closure varying between 20-100%.

Highest periods of foraging for Burrowing Owls occur just after sunset and just before sunrise. Burrowing Owls may perch or fly low along the ground to spot prey. Burrowing Owls may also hover 33-98 ft off the ground as a foraging approach, but also demonstrate typical raptor-type attacks when capturing prey (Martin 1973).","Burrowing Owls prefer habitats within deserts, grasslands, and shrub-steppe, and utilize well-drained, level to gently sloping areas characterized by sparse vegetation and bare ground such as moderately or heavily grazed pasture. They prefer short grass for nesting, but will forage over areas of tall vegetation (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 3). However, there is evidence that vegetation over 3.3 ft may be too tall for Burrowing Owls to locate prey. Types of foraging areas include cropland, pasture, prairie dog colonies, fallow fields, and sparsely vegetated areas (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 7). Burrowing Owls have been found in active prairie dog burrows, and are more likely to demonstrate increase survival and decreased predation at large, well-populated active prairie dog sites than smaller, inactive sites (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 5). Burrowing Owls also regularly utilize developed areas such as agricultural fields, golf courses, cemeteries, road allowances, airports, vacant urban lots, and fairgrounds (Poulin et al. 2011). ","The Burrowing Owls breeding range extends through most of the western United States from the eastern parts of California, Washington and Oregon through to the western edge of Minnesota and down into northern Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and western Oklahoma. The year-round range extends primarily through southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and into northern Mexico. Burrowing Owls may also occur year-round in Florida and areas of the Caribbean. The Burrowing Owl wintering range extends from northern Mexico down into South America (Poulin et al. 2011). Burrowing Owls are migratory; however some Burrowing Owls have been known to winter on their breeding grounds (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 9; Poulin et al. 2011). In the Northern Great Plains, Burrowing Owls begin fall migration in late August and migrate through mid-October, showing a southern migration route through Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma (Poulin et al. 2011).","The primary reasons for the decline of Burrowing Owls have been identified as the elimination of burrowing mammals through control programs and habitat loss (USFWS 2002). Concerns with wind development and Burrowing Owls include habitat destruction and fragmentation (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 9). Collision with wind turbines is also a potential risk for this species as demonstrated by the mass mortality at the Altamont Pass facility (Smallwood and Thelander 2008).  ","Egg laying for Burrowing Owls begins in late-April and extends to early/mid-May. Burrowing Owls nest underground and commonly use black-tailed prairie dog and Richardsons ground squirrel burrows for their nesting sites. However, they have been known to use burrows created by other kinds of prairie dogs, squirrels and other burrowing animals as their nest sites in the absence of these species (Dechant et al. 1999, revised 2002, p. 3). Burrows are often selected in areas where there are a high density of burrows and are often surrounded by bare ground or very low and sparse vegetation. Nests usually contain one clutch per nest, but the female may re-nest if the first clutch is destroyed early in the breeding season. Young are born altricial, but can walk to occupy nearby burrows by two weeks of age. In non-migratory populations, nests are utilized and maintained throughout the year. It has been observed that many migratory Burrowing Owls return to the same burrows in subsequent years (Poulin et al. 2011). ","The Burrowing Owl is small ground-dwelling diurnal owl with several distinctive features including its bright yellow eyes, long legs and characteristic bobbing behavior when disturbed. Burrowing Owls range in length from 19-25 cm and have brown and buffy-white spotted feathers with a buffy-white eyebrow. Males are slightly larger than females. Juveniles are distinguishable from adults by their solid buff colored breast and wings (Poulin et al. 2011).

Soil moisture is a critical determinant of growth, flowering, and distribution of western prairie fringed orchid (USFWS 2009). This species is dependent on mycorrhizal fungi, especially for seed germination and for nutritional support before plants are capable of photosynthesis. 

The persistence of western prairie fringed orchid is dependent on periodic disturbance by fire, mowing, or grazing, but these practices may also cause adverse effects and must be carefully implemented.

The species occurs in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.  Upstream depletions to the Platte River system in Colorado and Wyoming may affect the species in Nebraska.
",No information available,"In its recovery plan (USFWS 1996) the Service mostly reiterated the threats it described in the final listing rule, but emphasized that conversion of habitat to cropland was the greatest remaining threat to southern populations.  It also emphasized that little was known about how to ensure that burning, grazing, and mowing are conducted in a manner not adverse to western prairie fringed orchid populations and pointed out that actions that directly or indirectly lower water levels in the rooting zone of plants have the potential of serious adverse impacts.  In addition, it implied that potential impacts of pesticides to western prairie fringed orchid and its pollinators was also a threat.  

As with the conservation of other rare prairie species that exist in fragments of a once vast ecosystem, successful management consists of careful application of practices that are essential for conserving the habitat, while ensuring that associated adverse effects are avoided or minimized.
","Although Western prairie fringed orchid forms tubers and vegetative shoots from existing plants, pollination is required for seed production. Western prairie fringed orchid is pollinated by a few species of sphinx moths (USFWS 2009).

Wood storks capture their prey by a specialized technique known as grope-feeding or tacto-location.  Feeding often occurs in water 6 to 10 inches deep, where a stork probes with the bill partly open.  When a fish touches the bill it quickly snaps shut.  The average response time of this reflex is 25 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest reflexes known in vertebrates.  Wood storks use thermals to soar as far as 80 miles from nesting to feeding areas.  Since thermals do not form in early morning, wood storks may arrive at feeding areas later than other wading bird species such as herons.  Energy requirements for a pair of nesting wood storks and their young is estimated at 443 pounds of fish for the breeding season (based on an average production of 2.25 fledglings per nest).","The southeast United States breeding population of the wood stork declined from an estimated 20,000 pairs in the 1930's to about 10,000 pairs by 1960, and to a low of approximately 5,000 pairs in the late 1970s.  Nesting primarily occurred in the Everglades.  The generally accepted explanation for the decline of the wood stork is the reduction in food base (primarly small fish) necessary to support breeding colonies.  This reduction is attributed to loss of wetland habitat as well as to changes in water hydroperiods from draining wetlands and changing water regimes by constructing levees, canals, and floodgates to alter water flow in south Florida.

Wood storks have a unique feeding technique and require higher prey concentrations than other wading birds.  Optimal water regimes for the wood stork involve periods of flooding, during which prey (fish) populations increase, alternating with dryer periods, during which receding water levels concentrate fish at higher densities coinciding with the stork's nesting season.  Loss of nesting habitat (primarily cypress swamps) may be affecting wood storks in central Florida, where nesting in non-native trees and in man-made impoundments has been occurring recently.  Less significant factors known to affect nesting success include prolonged drought and flooding, raccoon predation on nests, and human disturbance of rookeries.","The current population of adult birds is difficult to estimate, since not all nest each year.  Presently, the wood stork breeding population is believed to be greater than 8,000 nesting pairs (16,000 breeding adults).  Nesting has been restricted to Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, however they may have formerly bred in most of the southeastern United States and Texas.  A second distinct, non-endangered population of wood storks breeds from Mexico to northern Argentina.

Storks from both populations move northward after breeding, with birds from the southeastern United States population moving as far north as North Carolina on the Atlantic coast and into Alabama and eastern Mississippi along the Gulf coast, and storks from Mexico moving up into Texas and Louisiana and as far north as Arkansas and Tennessee along the Mississippi River Valley.  There have been occasional sightings in all States along and east of the Mississippi River, and sporadic sightings in some States west of the Mississippi and in Ontario.",No information available,"The wood stork is a highly colonial species usually nesting in large rookeries and feeding in flocks.  Age at first breeding is 3 years but typically do so at 4.  Nesting periods vary geographically.  In South Florida, wood storks lay eggs as early as October and fledge in February or March.  However, in north and central Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, storks lay eggs from March to late May, with fledging occurring in July and August.  Nests are frequently located in the upper branches of large cypress trees or in mangroves on islands.  Several nests are usually located in each tree.  Wood storks have also nested in man-made structures.  Storks lay two to five eggs, and average two young fledged per successful nest under good conditions.","Wood storks are large, long-legged wading birds, about 5O inches tall, with a wingspan of 60 to 65 inches. The plumage is white except for black primaries and secondaries and a short black tail. The head and neck are largely unfeathered and dark gray in color. The bill is black, thick at the base, and slightly decurved. Immature birds are dingy gray and have a yellowish bill.

On the East coast, periodic outbreaks of tent caterpillars draw cuckoos to eat as many as 100 caterpillars in one sitting. Fall webworms and the larvae of gypsy, brown-tailed, and white-marked tussock moths are also part of the cuckoos lepidopteran diet, often supplemented with beetles, ants, and spiders. They take advantage of the annual outbreaks of cicadas, katydids and crickets, and will hop to the ground to chase frogs and lizards. In summer and fall, cuckoos forage on small wild fruits, including elderberries, blackberries and wild grapes. In winter, fruit and seeds become a larger part of their diet. ","Yellow-billed Cuckoos use wooded habitat with dense cover and water nearby, including woodlands with low, scrubby, vegetation, overgrown orchards, abandoned farmland, and dense thickets along streams and marshes. In the Midwest, look for cuckoos in shrublands of mixed willow and dogwood, and in dense stands of small trees such as American elm. In the central and eastern U.S., Yellow-billed Cuckoos nest in oaks, beech, hawthorn, and ash. In the West, nests are often placed in willows along streams and rivers, with nearby cottonwoods serving as foraging sites. ","Yellow-billed Cuckoos breed throughout much of the eastern and central U.S., winter almost entirely in South America east of the Andes, and migrate through Central America.   The western subspecies (C.a. occidentalis) has disappeared over much of the western U.S. and now occurs as a rare breeder in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas.","In the West, much of the Yellow-Billed Cuckoos riparian habitat has been converted to farmland and housing, leading to population declines and the possible extirpation of cuckoos from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada. Once common in the California Central Valley, coastal valleys, and riparian habitats east of the Sierra Nevada, habitat loss now constrains the California breeding population to small numbers of birds. As long-distance, nocturnal migrants, Yellow-Billed Cuckoos are also vulnerable to collisions with tall buildings, cell towers, radio antennas, wind turbines, and other structures.Yellow-billed Cuckoo populations declined by 1.6 percent per year between 1966 and 2010.

","Movement is not well understood.  During non-spawning months, there is a general movement to portions of the riffle with smaller substrate, such as gravel or cobble, and less turbulence (Robison and Harp 1981).  Weston and Johnson (2005) observed that the yellowcheek darter moved very little during a one-year migration study.  It was noted the yellowcheek darter appears to be a relatively non-mobile species, with 19 of 22 recaptured individuals found within nine meters (29.5 ft) of their original capture position after periods of several months (Weston and Johnson 2005).  

Yellowcheek darter is endemic to the Little Red River system in the Boston Mountains of north central Arkansas.  It occurs in the South, Archey, Middle, Beech, and Devils Forks of the Little Red River.",Maximum lifespan is around five years (McDaniel 1984).  ,"Yellowcheek Darter males and females reach sexual maturity at one year of age(McDaniel 1984).  Spawning occurs from late May through June in portions of riffles with swift to moderately swift water velocities, often around or under the largest substrate particles (McDaniel 1984), although brooding females have been found at the head of riffles in smaller gravel substrate (Wine et al. 2000).  

Researchers have suggested the yellowcheek darterYellowcheek Darter deposits eggs on the undersides of large cobble in swift water (McDaniel 1984).  Wine and Blumenshine (2002) noted, during laboratory spawning, yellowcheek darter females bury themselves in fine gravel or sand substrates (often behind large cobble or boulders) with only their heads and caudal fin exposed.  A male yellowcheek darter will then position upstream of the buried female and fertilize her eggs as she releases them in a vibrating motion.  Clutch size and nest defense behavior were not observed by Wine and Blumenshine (2002), but laboratory spawning efforts by Conservation Fisheries, Inc. noted clutch sizes were routinely between 20-40 eggs (CFI 2007). ","The yellowcheek darter is a small and laterally-compressed fish that attains a maximum standard length of about 6.4 cm (2.5 in), and has a moderately sharp snout, deep body, and deep caudal peduncle (Raney and Suttkus 1964).

Specific habitat types/use areas include foraging and drinking sites, resting areas, travel corridors and others.

Florida manatees, living at the northern limit of the species' range, have little tolerance for cold.  Historically, this sub-species has sought out natural, warm-water sites, including springs, deep water areas, and areas thermally influenced by the Gulf Stream, as refuges from the cold.  In the 1930s and 40s, industrial plants, including power plants, paper mills, etc., were built along coastal and riverine shoreline areas.  Plants discharging large volumes of heated discharge water into areas accessible to manatees have attracted large numbers of wintering manatees to these warm-water sites ever since.  In the spring, manatees leave the warm-water sites and may travel great distances during the summer, only to return to warm water sites in the fall.

Antillean manatees are found in coastal and riverine systems in South and Central America (from Brazil to Mexico) and in the Greater and Lesser Antilles throughout the Caribbean Basin.  Due to a variety of human activities (hunting, loss of habitat, etc.), manatees have been extirpated from many areas and their distribution is patchy throughout the region.  USFWS recovery activities primarily focus on manatees in Florida and Puerto Rico, although the species is managed throughout its range.","Per a 2017 statewide survey, there are at least 6620 Florida manatees.  A recent estimate of statewide Florida manatee abundance is 8,810 with 95% probability (actual abundance between 7,520 and 10,280).  Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico are thought to include about 140 animals.  Both stocks are thought to be stable and perhaps increasing in certain areas.  Survival and reproductive rates are generally positive, even in the face of increasing human-related threats, including watercraft, habitat loss, and other activities.","Manatees mature at three to five years of age.  Mature females go into heat for anywhere from two to four weeks.  Mating activity can occur throughout the year.  When in heat, females will attract numerous males and mate repeatedly; aggregations that include an estrus or focal female and numerous males are described as mating herds.  Gestation lasts for about 13 months and cows usually give birth to a single calf; twinning is known to occur.  While calving primarily peaks in the spring, calves may be born at any time of the year.  Reproductive senescence is poorly described; a known Blue Spring female has given birth to 16 individual calves over a period of about 35 years.  A calf may remain with its mother for about two years.  Calving intervals range from two and three years.  Maximum life expectancy for a manatee is unknown but a manatee in captivity lived to 69 years of age.","Manatees are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibits the take (i.e., harass, hunt, capture, or kill) of all marine mammals. Manatees are found in marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments. The West Indian manatee, Trichechus manatus, includes two distinct subspecies, the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus). While morphologically distinctive, both subspecies have many common features. Manatees have large, seal-shaped bodies with paired flippers and a round, paddle-shaped tail. They are typically grey in color (color can range from black to light brown) and occasionally spotted with barnacles or colored by patches of green or red algae. The muzzle is heavily whiskered and coarse, single hairs are sparsely distributed throughout the body. Adult manatees, on average, are about nine feet long (3 meters) and weigh about 1,000 pounds (200 kilograms). At birth, calves are between three and four feet long (1 meter) and weigh between 40 and 60 pounds (30 kilograms).",200

Kootenai sturgeon occur in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia, Canada, and are restricted to approximately 167.7 River Mile (RM) of the Kootenai River extending from Kootenai Falls, Montana, located 31 RM below Libby Dam, Montana, downstream through Kootenay Lake to Corra Linn Dam at the outflow from Kootenay Lake in British Columbia.  Approximately 45 percent of the species range is located within British Columbia.
Many Kootenai sturgeon migrate within this restricted portion of the Kootenai River system to spawn in the Kootenai River, and they spend part of their life in Kootenay Lake in British Columbia. The Kootenai River originates in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, flows south into Montana, northwest into Idaho, then north through the Kootenai Valley back into British Columbia, where it flows through Kootenay Lake and joins the Columbia River at Castlegar, British Columbia. 
The wild population now consists of an aging cohort of large, old fish. The population has declined from approximately 7,000 white sturgeon in the late 1970s to 760 fish in 2000.  At the current mortality rate of 9 percent per year, fewer than 500 adults remained in 2005 and there may be fewer than 50 remaining by 2030.  Current data indicate that population abundance declines by about half every 7.4 years.
During the last 14 years of intensive monitoring (using techniques proven suitable elsewhere) only one hatching embryo has been found and no free-swimming larvae or young-of-the-year have  been captured.  Estimates show that annually an average of 10 juvenile sturgeon are naturally reproduced in the Kootenai River. This suggests high levels of mortality which are unlikely to sustain the historic population of Kootenai sturgeon.

Young chicks are fed by their parents. Summer foods include large nymphal or larval forms of insects, frogs, rodents, small birds, minnows, and berries. Foods utilized during migration are poorly documented but include frogs, fish, plant tubers, crayfish, insects, and agricultural grains. The largest amount of time is spent feeding in harvested grain fields. In the winter, whooping cranes forage for blue crabs, clams and the plant wolfberry in the brackish bays, marshes, and salt flats on the edge of the Texas mainland and on barrier islands. Occasionally, cranes fly to upland sites when attracted by fresh water to drink or by foods such as acorns, snails, crayfish and insects, and then return to the marshes to roost. Uplands are particularly attractive when partially flooded by rainfall, burned to reduce plant cover or when food is less available in the salt flats and marshes. ","The whooping crane breeds, migrates, winters, and forages in a variety of wetland and other habitats, including coastal marshes and estuaries, inland marshes, lakes, ponds, wet meadows and rivers, and agricultural fields. Whooping cranes breed and nest in wetland habitat in Wood-Buffalo National Park, Canada.  Bulrush is the dominant vegetation type in the potholes used for nesting, although cattail, sedge, musk-grass, and other aquatic plants are common. Nest sites are primarily located in shallow diatom ponds that contain bulrush. During migration, whooping cranes use a variety of habitats; however wetland mosaics appear to be the most suitable. For feeding, whooping cranes primarily use shallow, seasonally and semi permanently flooded palustrine wetlands for roosting, and various cropland and emergent wetlands.  In Nebraska, whooping cranes also often use riverine habitats.  Wintering habitat in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas, includes salt marshes and tidal flats on the mainland and barrier islands, dominated by salt grass, saltwort, smooth cordgrass, glasswort, and sea ox-eye.","The whooping crane is a bi-annual migrant, traveling between its summer habitat in central Canada, and its wintering grounds on the Texas coast, across the Great Plains of the U.S. in the spring and fall of each year.  The migratory corridor runs in an approximately straight line from the Canadian Prairie Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan through the Great Plains states of eastern Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  The complete corridor is approximately 2,400 miles (3,862 km) long by 220 miles (354 km) wide, a zone that encompasses 95% of known sightings of whooping cranes.  

Autumn migration normally begins in mid-September, with most birds arriving on the Texas wintering grounds between late October and mid-November.  Whooping cranes migrate south as singles, pairs, in family groups, or as small flocks of 3 to 5 birds. They are diurnal migrants and stop daily to feed and rest.  Local weather conditions influence distance and direction of travel, but whooping cranes generally are capable of reaching the autumn staging grounds in the north central portion of the Saskatchewan agricultural area on the second day of migration, where they remain for 2  4 weeks. The remainder of the migration from Saskatchewan to the wintering grounds is usually rapid, probably weather-induced, and may be completed in a week.

Whooping cranes occupy winter areas for almost half a year. Although close association with other whooping cranes is tolerated at times on the wintering grounds, pairs and family groups typically occupy and defend relatively discrete territories.

As spring approaches, dancing behavior (running, leaping and bowing, unison calling, and flying) increases in frequency, and is indicative of pre-migratory restlessness.  Spring migration departure dates are normally between March 25 and April 15, with the last birds usually leaving by May 1.
","The endangered whooping crane is a flagship species for the North American wildlife conservation movement, symbolizing the struggle for survival that characterizes endangered species worldwide.  The Aransas-Wood Buffalo flock has come back from a low of only 15 birds in 1941 to reach 270 individuals in 2008, with annual growth averaging 4.6%.  A record 74 nesting pairs were located in May, 2010.  In the United States, the whooping crane was listed as endangered in 1970 by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  In Canada, the crane was designated as threatened in 1978 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and listed as endangered under the Canadian Species at Risk Act in 2003.  The International Recovery Plan was last updated in 2007.

Historically, population declines were caused by shooting and destruction of nesting habitat in the prairies from agricultural development. The species was listed because of low population numbers, slow reproductive potential (sexual maturity is delayed and pairs average less than one chick annually), cyclic nesting and wintering habitat suitability, a hazardous 4,000 km migration route that is traversed twice annually, and many human pressures on the wintering grounds.  Current threats to wild cranes include collisions with manmade objects such as power lines and fences, shooting, chemical spills along the Intracoastal Waterway that bisects its winter habitat, predators, disease, habitat destruction, severe weather, and a loss of two thirds of the original genetic material.  Threats to the captive flock include disease, accidents, and in-breeding.
","Whooping cranes are monogamous, forming pairs and laying eggs as early as 3 years of age, although the average age of first egg production is 5 years. They show considerable fidelity to their breeding territories, and normally nest in the same general vicinity each year. These nesting territories, termed ""composite nesting areas"", vary considerably in size, ranging from about 1.3 to 47.1 km2 (0.8 to 29 mi2) but averaging 4.1 km2 (2.5 mi2). Adjoining pairs usually nest at least 1 km (0.6 mi) apart.  From the initiation of egg laying, until chicks are a few months of age, the activities of pairs and family groups are restricted to the breeding territory. Eggs are normally laid in late April to mid-May, and hatching occurs about 1 month later. The incubation period is from 29 to 31 days. Whooping cranes usually produce clutches of 2 eggs laid 48-60 hours apart. Incubation begins with the first egg laid, resulting in asynchronous hatching of the eggs. This asynchrony may follow the insurance hypothesis, where parents add marginal offspring to their clutch/brood as a hedge against early failure of core brood members.  Whooping crane parents share incubation and brood-rearing duties. Except for brief intervals, one member of the pair remains on the nest at all times.","The whooping crane occurs only in North America and is North Americas tallest bird, with males approaching 1.5 m (5 ft) when standing erect. The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo. The total population of wild and captive whooping cranes in July, 2010, was 535.

Insects include beetles, caterpillars, bees, ants and wasps, true bugs, and flies. These are an important component of their diet in the spring, when animal prey make up 71% of overall diet versus 3% in September. The song sparrow also eats crustaceans and mollusks on the coast.","The basic requirements of the Channel Island Song Sparrow are very similar to those described for mainland Song Sparrows: moderately dense scrubby vegetation for nesting, escape cover, and foraging; a source of standing or running water or, in dry scrub habitats, constant moisture from fog or dew; adequate light; and exposed ground or leaf litter for foraging. Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub due to wind.","Referred to as the Channel Island or Santa Barbara Song Sparrow, graminea is a California endemic subspecies. It is restricted to San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands, and formerly to Santa Barbara and San Clemente Islands.  ","Song Sparrows have vanished from two islands off Southern California, the result of more frequent fires and introduced hares altering the sparrows' habitat.

The rusty patched emerges early in spring and is one of the last species to go into hibernation. It needs a constant supply and diversity of flowers blooming throughout the colony's long life, April through September.","Rusty patched bumble bees once occupied grasslands and tallgrass prairies of the Upper Midwest and Northeast, but most grasslands and prairies have been lost, degraded, or fragmented by conversion to other uses. Bumble bees need areas that provide nectar and pollen from flowers, nesting sites (underground and abandoned rodent cavities or clumps of grasses), and overwintering sites for hibernating queens (undisturbed soil).",No information available,No information available,"Rusty patched bumble bee colonies have an annual cycle. In spring, solitary queens emerge and find nest sites, collect nectar and pollen from flowers and begin laying eggs, which are fertilized by sperm stored since mating the previous fall. Workers hatch from these first eggs and colonies grow as workers collect food, defend the colony, and care for young. Queens remain within the nests and continue laying eggs. In late summer, new queens and males also hatch from eggs. Males disperse to mate with new queens from other colonies. In fall, founding queens, workers and males die. Only new queens go into diapause (a form of hibernation) over winter - and the cycle begins again in spring. ","Historically, the rusty patched bumble bee was broadly distributed across the eastern United States, Upper Midwest, and southern Quebec and Ontario in Canada. Since 2000, this bumble bee has been reported from only 13 states and 1 Canadian province: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada. 
Rusty patched bumble bees live in colonies that include a single queen and female workers. The colony produces males and new queens in late summer. Queens are the largest bees in the colony, and workers are the smallest. All rusty patched bumble bees have entirely black heads, but only workers and males have a rusty reddish patch centrally located on the back.

The scrub adjoining these dunes is populated by oaks and sand pine or palmetto.  A study conducted on Merritt Island indicated that the southeastern beach mice may prefer open sand habitat with clumps of palmetto and sea grapes, or dense scrub habitat dominated by palmetto, sea grape, and wax myrtle; over seaward habitat with sea oats (Extine and Stout 1987).  Little specific information exists about these species' burrowing habits, although they are presumed to be similar to those of beach mice on the Gulf Coast.  Sometimes beach mice use the former burrows of ghost crabs, but usually they dig their own.  Burrow entrances are generally found on the sloping side of a dune at the base of a clump of grass.  The burrows are used for nesting and food storage as well as a refuge.","The distribution of the southeastern beach mouse has declined significantly, particularly in the southern part of its range.  Historically, it was reported to occur from Florida's Ponce Inlet in Volusia County to Hollywood Beach in Broward County.  More recently, the southeastern beach mouse has been reported only from Volusia County (Smyrna Dunes Park), Federal lands in Brevard County (Canaveral National Seashore, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station), and in Indian River County (Sebastian Inlet State Recreation Area).  Large, healthy populations of the southeastern beach mouse are still found on the beaches of Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Brevard County-all federally protected lands.

The dominant plants of tidal salt marshes in San Pablo Bay, which may be used in the construction of nests, are California Cord Grass (Spartina foliosa) in low elevations, Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at higher elevations, and Gumplant (Grindelia stricta) on the highest ground along slough edges and levees.","The Samuels Song Sparrow is a California Endemic subspecies, restricted mainly to the fringes of the San Pablo Bay portion of the San Francisco Bay estuary. ","Further habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the primary threats to the Samuels Song Sparrow. Alteration of marsh habitat by invasive cord grass (Spartina spp.) may also have adverse effects. There also are concerns that habitat fragmentation and lack of sufficient dispersal corridors will impede dispersal following catastrophic disturbance or habitat changes (Scollon 1993, Cogswell 2000). Breeding Bird Survey data is inadequate for trend assessment.  For more information on this species, refer to the following resource:

Their bill is short and stout, tail long and rounded, and wings broad.  Song Sparrows are streaky and brown, with thick streaks on a white chest and flanks. On a closer look, the head is a mix of warm red-brown and slaty-gray. However, these shades as well as the amount of streaking, vary extensively across North America.

","Suisun Song Sparrows are associated primarily with tidal channels, especially in marshes where Pickleweed dominates and Gumplant lines the channels. As with all Song Sparrow subspecies, dense vegetation is required for nesting sites, song perches, and cover for refuge from predators. Maxillaris prefers to nest in dense vegetation. Nest may be found in a variety of substrates including Scirpus americanus, S. maritimus, S. acutus, Grindelia stricta, Lepidium latifolium, Salicornia virginica, Juncus balticus, Distichlis spicata, and Triglochin maritima.","The Suisun Song Sparrow, a California endemic subspecies, is restricted to the Suisun Marsh from the Carquinez Straight east to the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers near Antioch. ","Further habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the primary threats to the Suisun Song Sparrow. Alteration of marsh habitat by non-native invasive Cord Grass may also have adverse effects. Increased diversion of fresh water from the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers has caused increases in salinity in Suisun Bay, which may eventually favor vegetation adapted to saline rather than brackish conditions, since prime habitat for maxillaris is tidal marshes.

The peak of mating occurs in early November with a 180 day gestation period following conception. Bighorn sheep generally give birth to single young, but there is a low incidence of twins. Most lambs are born during May but may be born between mid-April and early July. As new forages grow in the spring with warming temperatures, bighorn sheep begin migrating to higher elevations and ewes give birth to lambs in extremely steep terrain. Within a matter of days, newborn lambs begin following their mothers and continue migrating to higher elevations.","The Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep is similar in appearance to other desert associated bighorn sheep. The species' coat shows a great deal of color variation, ranging from almost white to fairly dark brown. The belly, rump patch, back of legs, muzzle, and eye patch are all white. Males and females have permanent horns, but they are much larger in males. In females, the horns are slender and sabre-like, never forming more than half a curl. In males, the horns are massive and curl up, back over the ears, then curve down, forward, and up past the cheeks.  As the animals age, their horns become rough and scarred, and will vary in color from yellowish-brown to dark brown. In comparison to many other desert bighorn sheep, the horns of the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep are generally more divergent as they coil out from the base.

However, it is well documented that habitat needs for many of the sub-species of Northern bobwhite tend to be similar with respect to vegetation structure, but that plant species compositions throughout the various geographic ranges of these sub-species may vary significantly (Guthery et al. 2000).  The basics required are a wide variety of forbs and associated insects for food, grasses of the appropriate density and conformation for nesting, and shrubs for escape cover and thermoregulation.  

It is assumed, therefore, that plant species preferred by masked bobwhites are indicative of native plants species present in mesic, subtropical Sonoran grassland areas within the historic range of masked bobwhites. In addition to key plant species described above, important native plant species associated with masked bobwhite habitats areas include a wide variety of native forbs, annual and biennial grass, perennial bunch grass, leguminous shrub and tree species.  These include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), rothrockâs gramma (Bouteloua rothrockii), Arizona cottontop, cane beardgrass 
(Bothriochloa barbinodis), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum),  sacaton, blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis),  whiteball acacia, wolf-berry (Lycium spp.), gray-thorn (Zizphus obtusifolia), and desert hackberry (Celtis pallid) (Brown and Ellis 1977, Tomlinson 1972a;1972b; 1984, Wells 2005, Goodwin and Hungerford 1977, Goodwin 1982, Steve McLaughlin pers. com.).

While not previously documented, refuge biologists have observed a close association with pen reared and released masked bobwhites and wait-a-minute shrub (Mimosa biuncifera) and Gatuno shrub (Mimosa dysocarpa).  It is thought that mimosa shrubs provide an essential winter food from dehisced seeds and needed cover and serve as a segregate to the dense stands of whiteball acacia and bundleflower shrubs found in prime bobwhite habitat areas of Sonora.

Nesting cover consists primarily of bunch grasses.  Any clump that is âthe diameter of a basketball or pie plateâ and greater than 8 inches tall is appropriate nesting habitat (Angelo et al. 2005). Bunches should not exceed 500 per acre, the ideal being roughly 300 per acre. Woody cover is as essential as loafing cover for providing protection from predators year round and thermal protection in both winter and summer.  Ideal brush cover is between 3 and 10 feet tall and distributed across the landscape.  Brush should be dense above and open at ground level. In northern bobwhite regions the Huggins 50:50 Rule is the standard: âA bobwhite should never be more than 50 yards from a clump of brush 50 feet in diameterâ (Angelo et al. 2005).  

Screening cover with bare ground or short ground cover is needed.  Nests are normally located within 50-60 feet of openings such as disked strips, roads or fields.  Baby quail are unable to fly and need bare ground in order to move.  An overstory of weeds and grasses screen the young quail from predators.  The growth form of the screening cover is most desirable when it forms dense clumps that provide a closed canopy above the quail and bare ground beneath.  The majority of the food for the birds in the fall and winter comes from forb seeds.  In addition, forbs attract insects which provide food for young quail. Ground cover should be at least 8 inches tall, but less than 2 ft. tall (Angelo et al. 2005).  

Interspersion of the various cover types is essential.  A standard rule of thumb is to provide all the needed cover types on every acre of land (Angelo et al. 2005)",No information available,"Camou et al. (1998) found that masked bobwhite populations increased in 11 of 13 years when mean summer precipitation was >20 cm (7.9 in.), but declined in 13 of 14 years when mean summer precipitation was <20 cm.  High temperatures in combination with dry atmospheric conditions may reduce the amount of thermally suitable habitat (Guthery et al. 2001c) as heat reduces the proportion of bobwhite hens that lay eggs and the proportion of males that produce sperm.

Casual observations by BANWR staff of mortalities of captive masked bobwhites held in outdoor pens with varying degrees of cover seem to indicate that there may be a lowered tolerance for extreme cold temperatures.  When night-time temperatures drop into the 10 to 20 degree Fahrenheit (F) range (-12 to -7 degree Celsius (C)), or when cold and rainy conditions occur together, birds are sometimes found dead in roost rings.  It is not known how this might affect truly wild birds, since the captive birds had limited choices for seeking cover, and wild birds may be able to move out of colder areas into better roost sites. 
","Hernandez et al. (2006) discussed the differences between reproduction in masked bobwhites and other subspecies.  As a bird that is adapted to a semi-arid environment characterized by pronounced precipitation peaks in late summer, the masked bobwhite initiates breeding much later in the year and experiences a much shorter breeding season than its eastern counterparts.   In masked bobwhites, breeding typically commences in June and the season lasts only about 90 days, corresponding to the monsoonal rains.   Eastern subspecies initiate breeding in March and have approximately 120 days to complete the breeding season.  Northern bobwhites, in general, require 47-55 days to lay and incubate their first clutch, and require 20-34 days between clutches (Burger et al. 1995).  Mathematically speaking, re-nest attempts by masked bobwhite following nest destruction or abandonment are not likely due to the short duration of monsoon.  This significantly reduces the reproductive potential and associated productivity of masked bobwhite as compared to other subspecies bobwhite.","The adult male masked bobwhite has a rich rufous-red (cinnamon)
breast and a black head and throat. Some males have a white 
to yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   
elsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  
The head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back
feathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat
similar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.

The female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff
throat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other 
bobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.
Female masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.

Guthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked 

bobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation

while Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for 

higher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used 

areas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.

In another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat 

component was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable 

range for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features 

were at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable 

levels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat 

variable by managing other variables.

Exposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to 

Gambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to 

ground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures 

(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. 

tall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby 

allowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)

Clay phacelia is found on steep hillsides of shaley clay colluvium on an extremely limited band of soil derived from an upper member of the Green River geologic formation called Green River Shale in Utah County, Utah (USFWS 1994). Populations of the species grow on different soil types along the railroad that bisects the habitat. The plants east of the railroad grow mainly on a finely- textured clay derived from a poorly consolidated shale member of the formation. Those from west of the railroad grow on a platey slope. Occupied soils averaged about 1/3 clay, 1/3 silt, and 1/3 sand, and are generally covered with pebble fragments or flat slabs of lithified shale (Armstrong 1992). All soils where Clay phacelia occurs are basic, with pH ranging from 7.7- 7.9 for the occupied sites (Armstrong 1992). Concentrations of boron, zinc, manganese, and magnesium were higher at sites occupied by Clay phacelia than at unoccupied sites. Concentrations of sodium were higher at unoccupied sites than at occupied sites, suggesting an aversion to high salt soils (Armstrong 1992).  

Occupied sites are xeric due to the steepness of the slopes and southeast- to west-facing aspects. Most precipitation is in the form of snowfall during the winter months and spring rains through April of each year (Armstrong 1992). ",No information available,"Associated vegetation includes sparse pinyon-juniper or mountain brush communities (Armstrong 1992, USDA 1999). Associated species include the yellow-flowered buckwheat (Eriogonum brevicaule), Amelanchier alnifolia (Nutt.) Nutt. (serviceberry), Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Gambel oak), Stipa hymenoides (Indian ricegrass), and houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Clay phacelia does not do well in competition with other vegetation, and the actively eroding shale slopes where this species occurs likely discourages competitors (Aanderud and Harper 1997; USDA 1999). Additional associated vegetative cover include sparse stands of pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) or mountain brush (Amelanchier alnifolia-Cercocarpus montanus-Rhus aromatica) (Armstrong 1992). ","Germination for Clay phacelia takes place in late summer or early autumn, stimulated by late summer or early autumn storms. Initial foliage leaves are small, but by early to mid-October they have formed into basal rosettes from 0.4 to 2.8 inches (1 to 7 centimeters (cm)) in width.  Rosettes grow slowly under the snow, and bolt only after the snow melts the soil and air temperatures increase significantly in May (Service 1982).  The first of the seasons flowers begin opening by late May, and full blooming is reached in late June or early July.  Plant size appears to be a function of available soil moisture.  As the size of the plant increases, the number of flowers displayed becomes greater.  Spring and summer precipitation is necessary to allow plants to continue flowering through the summer and into autumn, with the last of the seasons flowers observed in mid-October (Service 1982).  Clay phacelia has the capacity of developing four mature seeds per fruit and can be a very prolific seeder (Bellagamba 2000). 

Pollination studies on the breeding system of the plants suggest the plants are obligate outcrossers (Smith et al. 1989) that require insect pollinators. Observations suggest that Clay phacelia is most likely not pollinator limited (Tepedino 2000). The following native bee species may be Clay phacelia pollinators: Dialictus perdifficilis, D. sedi, Evylaeus pulveris, Andrena walleye, A. pronorum and Halictus rubicundus (USFWS 1994; Tepedino 2000). These species are small to medium-sized, mostly solitary bees (Bartlett et al. 2008; DiTerlizzi et al. 2008) and have been seen in the vicinity of Clay phacelia.","Clay phacelia has blue to violet flowers and stands 4-14 inches (1-3.6 decimeters (dm)) tall.  Germination occurs in late summer and early autumn, and basal rosettes form in October.  Clay phacelia was formerly considered a winter annual but new data supports the idea that Clay phacelia is instead a true biennial (Meyer 2011). The life history of a biennial includes seedling emergence in the spring, growth of a rosette in the summer, vernalization   during the following winter, and flowering, seed set, and death the second summer (Meyer 2011).

The soils where clay-loving wild buckwheat is found are described as whitish, alkaline (with a pH over 7), clay soils of the Mancos shale formation, a Cretaceous marine sediment formation.  Mancos shale outcrops are relatively barren of vegetation in comparison to surrounding areas.  Several components of the clay soils of the Mancos shale limit plant growth: soils are fine-textured and lose moisture more readily; clay soils are compactable which limits gas exchange and thus root growth; clay soils hold more water which is unavailable for plant use; water infiltration is slow; and the extreme swelling and shrinking of the soils limits water availability and oxygen exchange for plant roots.  In addition, the soils are calcareous (containing calcium carbonate) with high pH values making for difficult growing conditions.
Clay-loving wild buckwheat plants are generally found within swales or drainages that are moister than surrounding areas.  Plant communities associated with Clay-loving wild buckwheat are characterized by low species diversity, low productivity, and minimal canopy cover.  The associated vegetation is sparse, with clay-loving wild buckwheat generally one of the dominant species.  In lower elevations near Delta, the dominant plant species is Atriplex corrugata (mat saltbrush), but at higher elevations near Montrose the dominant plant species is Artemesia nova (black sagebrush), although A. corrugata is still abundant.  Other associated species include Atriplex confertifolia (shadscale), A. gardneri (Gardners saltbush), Picrothamnus desertorum (formerly Artemisia spinescens) (bud sagebrush), Xylorhiza venusta (charming woodyaster), and another local endemic Penstemon retrorsus (Adobe Hills beardtongue).","Clay-loving wild buckwheat is endemic to the rolling clay (adobe) hills and flats immediately adjacent to the communities of Delta and Montrose, Colorado.  The plants extend from near Lazear, east of Delta on the northern end of the species range, to the southeastern edge of Montrose in Delta and Montrose Counties, Colorado, and occurs from 5,180 to 6,350 feet (1,579 to 1,965 meters) in elevation.  When a rectangle is drawn around all known occurrences, it measures roughly 11.5 miles (18.5 kilometers) from east to west and 28.5 miles (46 kilometers) from north to south.",No information available,"Clay-loving wild buckwheat is very long-lived.  Flowering typically occurs from late May to early September with individual flowers lasting fewer than 3 days. Clay-loving wild buckwheat requires a pollinator, and for much of the flowering season is the most abundant species in bloom in its habitat. Over 50 species of insects visit clay-loving wild buckwheat flowers.  Roughly half of these 50 species are native bees, and 18 species are native ants.  In one study, seed set was similar between plants that were pollinated by ants versus flying pollinators, suggesting the importance of ants to pollination of the species.  Some fruits are removed by harvester ants; however, no information is available for the species on seed dispersal mechanisms.
","Clay-loving wild buckwheat is a low growing, rounded, densely branched subshrub in the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae).  It has dark green leaves that roll inward and appear needle-like.  Though it only grows 6 to 8 inches tall, it is known to live for more than 18 years.  Its small white to cream colored flowers with pink veins are are clustered at the end of each branch.  Clay-loving wild buckwheat can be found in bloom from late May to early September.   

Clay-loving wild buckwheat is endemic to the rolling clay (adobe) hills and flats immediately adjacent to the communities of Delta and Montrose, Colorado.   These white alkaline clay barrens are derived from the Mancos Shale Formation, deposits from an ancient inland sea.  These barrens are inhospitable to only but the most adapted species.  Species found in association with the clay-loving wild buckwheat include mat saltbrush, black sagebrush, shadscale, and Adobe Hills beardtongue, another local endemic.  The unique soils that support clay-loving wild buckwheat populations are limited in their distribution.  This means that the clay-loving wild buckwheat is also limited in habitat.  

Clay-loving wild buckwheat was listed as an endangered species in 1984 because of the extremely limited range of its habitat and the high risk of habitat loss.  Increasing urban, residential, and agricultural development in the region poses to irreversible alter the habitat they rely on to survive.  Additionally, a major indirect effects of habitat conversion is the loss of the diversity of insect pollinators vital to the species reproduction.   On public lands, Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) recreation and grazing can also have significant impacts to the species These activities can cause direct loss of plants and habitat, as well as have indirect negative affects to the species from changes in pollinator communities, habitat, and hydrology, fragmentation of populations.  Over 50 species of insects (including bees, ants, and beetles) have been found to visit clay-loving wild buckwheat.  In these barren landscapes where few resources are present, plants such as the clay-loving wild buckwheat can be important in sustaining an ecosystem. Much of these populations (40%) occur on private lands.

Without high densities of snowshoe hares, lynx are unable to sustain populations despite utilizing a multitude of other prey when snowshoe hare numbers are low.  Other prey species include red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), grouse (Bonasa umbellus, Dendragopus spp., Lagopus spp.), flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii, S. Richardsonii), porcupine (Erethrizon dorsatum), beaver (Castor canadensis), mice (Peromyscus spp.), voles (Microtus spp.), shrews (Sorex spp.), fish. Ungulate carrion may also be consumed.","Lynx habitat can generally be described as moist boreal forests that have cold, snowy winters and a high-density snowshoe hare prey base.  The predominant vegetation of boreal forest is conifer trees, primarily species of spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.).  In the contiguous United States, the boreal forest type transitions to deciduous temperate forest in the Northeast and Great Lakes, and to subalpine forest in the west.  In mountainous areas, the boreal forests that lynx use are characterized by scattered moist forest types with high hare densities in a matrix of other habitats (e.g., hardwoods, dry forest, non-forest) with low hare densities.  In these areas, lynx incorporate the matrix habitat (non-boreal forest habitat elements) into their home ranges and use it for traveling between patches of boreal forest that support high hare densities where most foraging occurs.","Individual lynx maintain large home ranges generally between 12 to 83 square miles.  The size of lynx home ranges varies depending on abundance of prey, the animals gender and age, season, and the density of lynx populations.  When densities of snowshoe hares decline, for example, lynx enlarge their home ranges to obtain sufficient amounts of food to survive and reproduce.  Lynx also make long distance exploratory movements outside their home ranges.  Preliminary research supports the hypothesis that lynx home ranges at the southern extent of the species range are generally large compared to those in the core of the range in Canada, indicating a relative reduction of food resources in these areas.","In all regions within the range of the lynx in the contiguous United States, timber harvest, recreation, and their related activities are the predominant land uses affecting lynx habitat.  The primary factor that caused the lynx to be listed was the lack of guidance for the conservation of lynx and snowshoe hare habitat in plans for federally managed lands.  Landscape connectivity between lynx populations and habitats in Canada and the contiguous United States must be maintained.  Lynx movements may be negatively affected by high traffic volume on roads that bisect suitable lynx habitat, such as in the Southern Rockies, and in some areas, mortalities due to road kill are high.

","Breeding occurs through March and April in the north.  Kittens are born in May to June in southcentral Yukon.  The male lynx does not help with rearing young.  Yearling females may give birth during periods when hares are abundant. During periods of hare abundance in the northern taiga, litter size of adult females averages four to five kittens.  Litter sizes are typically smaller in lynx populations in the contiguous United States.","The lynx is a medium-sized cat with long legs, large, well-furred paws, long tufts on the ears, and a short, black-tipped tail.  The winter pelage of the lynx is dense and has a grizzled appearance with grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown fur on the back, and grayish-white or buff-white fur on the belly, legs and feet.  Summer pelage of the lynx is more reddish to gray-brown.  Adult males average 10 kilograms (22 pounds) in weight and 85 centimeters (33.5 inches) in length (head to tail), and females average 8.5 kilograms (19 pounds) and 82 centimeters (32 inches).  The lynxs long legs and large feet make it highly adapted for hunting in deep snow.

The distribution of lynx in North America is closely associated with the distribution of North American boreal forest.  In Canada and Alaska, lynx inhabit the classic boreal forest ecosystem known as the taiga.  The range of lynx populations extends south from the classic boreal forest zone into the subalpine forest of the western United States, and the boreal/hardwood forest ecotone in the eastern United States.  Forests with boreal features extend south into the contiguous United States along the North Cascade and Rocky Mountain Ranges in the west, the western Great Lakes Region, and northern Maine.  Within these general forest types, lynx are most likely to persist in areas that receive deep snow and have high-density populations of snowshoe hares, the principal prey of lynx.

In late April to late May the Dudley Bluffs bladderpod is easy to spot when its bright yellow flowers bloom. The rest of the year it is inconspicuous and may go unnoticed. Seeds are contained in small air-filled sacs, hence the common name bladderpod. Dudley Bluffs bladderpod is only known to occur in the Piceance Creek area, of Rio Blanco County in western Colorado, near the town of Meeker. Dudley Bluffs bladderpod is located primarily within the Duck Creek drainage. Its known habitat is flat or low angled slopes of the Thirteenmile Creek and Yellow Creek tongues of the Green River Formation. These shale outcrops have little soil development and are very harsh for plant growth; only plants adapted to survive in these conditions may thrive. The unique geology of the Piceance Creek area is important to the Dudley Bluffs bladderpod (and many other endemic plant species). It is also part of the Piceance Basins multimineral oil shale zone, an area containing large reserves of oil shale, natural gas, and minerals.

Dudley Bluffs twinpods clusters of bright-yellow flowers bloom for a short time between mid-May and June.  Dudley Bluffs twinpod is a close relative of the common sharpleaf twinpod (Physaria acutifolia) and it can be difficult to distinguish the two species at a glance.    
Dudley Bluffs twinpod is only known to occur in the general area of Piceance Creek in Rio Blanco County in western Colorado, near the town of Meeker.  The species is restricted to barren (sparsely vegetated), white outcrops and steep slopes of the Parachute Creek Member and certain tongues of the Green River Formation.  Its habitat is unique because it supports the growth of only a few plants that can tolerate difficult growing conditions.

These expansive clay soils are found on moderately steep slopes, benches, and ridge tops adjacent to valley floors of the southern Piceance Basin in Mesa and Garfield Counties, Colorado.  On these slopes and soils, DeBeque phacelia usually grows only on one unique small spot of ground that shows a slightly different texture, color, and crack pattern than the similar surrounding soils.  We do not have a precise scientific description of the soil features required to support this species.  The natural shrink-swell cracking process creates the conditions needed for the plants and seed bank to thrive.","DeBeque phacelia is a rare annual plant endemic to clay soils derived from the Atwell Gulch and Shire members of the Wasatch Formation in Mesa and Garfield Counties, Colorado.  A general range encompassing outlying occurrences of DeBeque phacelia includes about 82,231 ac (34,896 ha).  The growing town of DeBeque and about 10 mi (16.4 km) of Interstate 70 and the Colorado River bisect the species range.  ",DeBeque phacelia seeds can remain dormant for 5 years (and probably longer) until the combination and timing of temperature and precipitation are optimal for germination.,"DeBeque phacelia plants flower between late April and late June and set seed from mid-May through late June.  Individuals finish their life cycle by late June to early July, after which time they dry up and disintegrate or blow away, leaving no indication that the plants were present .  The species grows in a habitat with wide temperature fluctuations, long drought periods, and erosive saline soils.  Upon drying, cracks form in the shrink-swell clay soils.  Seeds plant themselves by falling into the cracks that close when wetted, thus covering the seeds.  ","DeBeque phacelia is a low-growing, herbaceous, spring annual plant with a tap root.  The stems are typically 0.8 to 3 in (2 to 8 cm) long, often branched at the base and mostly lying flat on the ground as a low rosette.  Stems are often deep red and more or less hairy with straight and stiff hairs.  Leaves are similarly hairy, reddish at maturity, 0.2 to 0.6 in (5 to 15 mm) long, egg-shaped or almost rectangular with rounded corners, with bases abruptly tapering to a wedge-shaped point.  Leaf margins are smooth or toothed.  The tube-shaped flowers are yellowish white, on short stems; the 5 petals are 0.16 to 0.19 in (4-5 mm) long; the stamens do not protrude beyond the petals.  The elongated egg-shaped seeds are 0.6 to 0.8 in (1.5 to 2 mm) long with 6 to 12 crosswise corrugations, and are blackish brown and somewhat iridescent. DeBeque phacelia is subject to human-caused modifications from natural gas exploration and production with associated expansion of pipelines, roads, and utilities; development within the Westwide Energy Corridor; increased access to the habitat by off highway vehicles; soil and seed disturbance by livestock and other disturbances; and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.",200

The young are fed primarily insect food items, such as grasshoppers, beetle larvae, and spiders (Haggerty 1986).  ","Historically, this species could be most commonly found in mature pine forests.  As most of such habitat has been logged and degraded, presently this sparrow can be found to inhabit regions of pine woodlands that have a more open understory and more grassy conditions than a dense and heavily vegetated lower-canopy brush (Hardin et al. 1982, Kadir and Wan 1987, Dunning and Watts 1990).  Frequent fires in the understory of old-growth pine forests are integral in maintaining this sparrows optimal habitat (Jim Cox and Clark Jones 2008).  Population counts of these sparrows have been shown to peak in the year directly following a fire and will drop rapidly in the years that follow as forest succession takes place and the understory of the forest becomes more densely vegetated (Tucker et al. 2004). It has been suggested that maintaining a three-year fire frequency regime in an area could ensure a quality of habitat that is necessary for maintaining happy and healthy Bachman Sparrow populations (Jim Cox and Clark Jones 2008). ","The geographic range of this species includes the coastal plain and Piedmont of the southeastern United States.  Typically, the populations of the southern coastal plains are non-migratory while those found in more northern regions are migrating populations (Sprunt and Chamberlain 1970, Armistead 1981). Calculations of the range and population size of Bachmans Sparrows have varied greatly within the last century and currently this species is a rare-sight in many of the areas in which it was once historically common.  The sparrow has been found to occupy restored pine lands that are being managed on behalf of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Wood et al. 2004). ","There is a lot that is still unknown about this songbird as very little formal studies were completed before the mid 80s.  Historically, the population expanded its range drastically and reached Canada in the northern limits of its range in 1917.  This expansion of geographic range peaked around 1920 and gradually declined.  Today this species is now rare or absent over most of its historic northern range as well as uncommon in most of its southern ranges (Saunders 1919, Brooks 1938, Weston 1968, Lee 1999¬). 

Populations of Bachmans Sparrow are negatively affected by fire suppression and heavy timber management in pine woods as these activities will increase the density of vegetation in the understory and altering the ecosystems characteristics that are preferred by the Sparrow. 
","This species exhibits a monogamous mating strategy, although systematics of the pair bond and courtship behaviors have been poorly documented (Haggerty 1988).  In central Arkansas, the total breeding season, from the laying of the first egg to independence of the last fledgling, spans a total of 170 days.  The species has been reported to have at least 2 broods per season with an average clutch size of four eggs and an average breeding cycle of 48 days per clutch (Haggerty 1986).  Females construct their nests out of grasses and forbes close to ground-level at the base of protective vegetation such as an overhanging grass clump or pine seedling. ","Bachmans Sparrow, endemic to North America, is described as a plain sparrow, distinguished by buffy brownish-gray under-plumage that is tinged with reddish streaks.  It has a large bill with a darker upper mandible, and darker tail feathers that are long and rounded.  The crown is reddish-brown and contains a thin dark line extending from the eye towards the back of the head as well as a thin dark streak extending back from its cheek.  This sparrow is more easily identifiable by its simple yet beautiful song than by plumage characteristics.  Individuals of this species exhibit a lot of terrestrial locomotion such as walking, hopping, running; often they appear to be reluctant to fly. This species is considered to be one of the most rapidly declining bird species in North America (Butcher and Niven 2007). Fire suppression, and the associated loss of optimal habitat, is considered to be one of the greatest causes of such decline.

It occurs from 3,300 to 5,700 feet in elevation within the transition zone of the Mogollon Rim where the upland Sonoran Desert, montane woodlands, and interior chaparral communities converge.  Its preferred habitat is exposed and stable bedrock or boulders exhibiting sufficient fracturing or rock fields. The cactus roots invade cracks, fissures, or interstices within exposed rock or narrow pockets between boulders where the microclimate provides the necessary periodic moisture, moist soils, and shelter from high temperatures (Crosswhite 1992; Cedar Creek Associates, Inc., 1996). Parent materials of preferred habitat are Schultze granite and Apache Leap tuff (dacite), both igneous in origin (Crosswhite 1992). To a lesser degree, Pinal Schist and the Pioneer Formation also provide habitat to the Arizona hedgehog cactus, but only where these formations expressed themselves as exposed bedrock (Cedar Creek Associates, Inc., 1996). The majority of cacti are found scattered on open, rocky slopes of 20 to 90 degrees, and steep fissured cliffs (Philips et al. 1979; Crosswhite 1992). Some plants may be found on level ground within eroded areas and in the understory of shrubs, but moderate to high shrub densities and associated deeper soils tend to preclude the cactus (Cedar Creek Associates, Inc., 1996). ",No information available,No information available,No information available,"The Arizona hedgehog cactus is a dark green succulent perennial plant in the Cactaceae family. Individual plants have large, robust stems that distinguish it from other species of Echinocereus. Stems range in size from 2.5 to 16 inches in height and six to ten inches in diameter. Immature plants occur as a solitary stem while mature plants are multi-branched (caespitose) with stems forming at the base, most often occurring in loose clusters of 4 to 20 stems, occasionally exceeding 50 to 100 stems (Arizona Rare Plant Committee 2001; Cedar Creek Associates, Inc. 1996). Each stem has 7 to 11 tuberculate ribs, nine to ten being the most common; ribbing strong. Spines are smooth and short; 5 to 11 radial spines per aerole (Arizona Rare Plant Committee 2001) but fewer than nine is often observed (Baker 2006). There are one to three gray or pinkish central spines that are less than 1.9 inches long, terete (smooth, cylindrical and tapering) (Zimmerman and Parfitt 2003) with the largest deflexed or bending downwards (AGFD 2003). Flowers erupt along the sides of the stem near the upper third of stem ribs, and are a brilliant crimson to deep red color. The flower is stout, erect, about 2 inches in diameter and 3 inches in length (AGFD 2003) appearing in late April to mid-May. Fruiting occurs from May to July with germination in midsummer (Zimmerman and Parfitt 2003; Arizona Rare Plant Society 2001). Fruits are red in color, globose, and spiny taking 3 months to mature (AGFD 2003). At maturity, the side of the fruit splits open (e.g., dehiscence) releasing up to 100 small black seeds (Parfitt and Christy 1992). The mechanism of seed dispersal is unknown. Its pollinators include native bees (Halictidae), honeybees (Apis mellifera), and hummingbirds (Annas hummingbird (Calypte anna), broad-billed hummingbird Cynanthus latirostris), and black-chinned hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri) (Aslan 2015).",200

The common name of the blowout penstemon comes from the blowouts in the Sandhills of Nebraska.  Blowouts are round or conical eroded areas, depressions formed in the sand when prevailing northwesterly winds scoop out the sides of the hills (Pool 1914 in Kottas 2008).  These eroded areas form on the sides of dunes when vegetative cover is removed or disturbed and wind action further exposes the slopes (Stubbendieck et al. 1989).  Blowout penstmeon is a pioneer species in these blowouts, frequently found among blowout grass [Redfieldia flexuosa (Thurb.) Vasey], which is often the first pioneer in a blowout (Kottas 2008).  Neither blowout grass nor blowout penstemon persist after other grasses begin to invade the blowout. The amount of suitable, active blowout habitat has declined markedly since settlement of the Sandhills region in the early 20th century.

",No information available,"The genus Penstemon is endemic to North America.  Of 275 species in the Penstemon genus, the blowout penstemon and only one other species are fragrant (Kottas 2008).  Blowout penstemon often is confused with shell-leaf penstemon (Penstemon grandiflorus) and narrow penstemon (Penstemon angustifolius), which also grow in the Nebraska Sandhills.  The color of narrow penstemon flowers is similar to blowout penstemon, but the size is only 1 inch long.  The flowers of shell-leaf penstemon are similar to blowout penstemon in size and color, but its leaves are spatula- or egg-shaped with the broades part above the middle.  Both the narrow and shell-leaf penstemons are common in denser vegetation along roadsides in the Sandhills, while the blowout penstemon is only found in blowouts and among very sparse vegetation (Stubbendieck et al., 1997).

","Blowout penstemon is a short-lived perennial plant, native to shifting sand and requiring moving sand in blowouts or sand ridges (in Wyoming) to thrive.  It grows from a tap root, initially producing a single stem, that often becomes decumbent. The stem roots readily where nodes are buried in the sand. Buds at the base of the stem break dormancy in the second spring, often producing multi-stemmed plants.  These plants typically flower in the second or third year (Kottas 2008), and individual plants live for six to eight years (Stubbendieck et al. 1997).  The lavender (or occasionally blue or white) flowers produce two-sided capsules (ovaries) bearing 25 to 35 discoid brown to black seeds (Fritz et al. 1992), although productivity of 14 seeds per capsule was found by Kottas (2008).  Seeds have a thick, hard seed coat and germination in the field is typically very low.  The seeds are adapted to dispersal by wind, which often distributes seed downwind across the edge of the blowout into the area of sand accumulation. Wind and animals aid in the seed dispersal. 

Seed numbers are highly variable among years and sites (Kottas 2008). Individual plants may produce approximately 1,400 to1,500 seeds (Kottas 2008; Fritz et al. 1992), but seed viability can reduce reproductive potential to an average of approximately 530 viable seeds per plant (Kottas 2008).  The number of seeds in the seedbank is typically low, due mainly to predation by small mammals at the time of seed rain (Kottas 2008; Stubbendieck, pers comm.).  Kottas (2008) investigated the effects of floral herbivory by insects and fungal infection on seed production and viability.  She reported that treatments of plants with insecticide or fungicide did not significantly affect total seed output, weight or viability (Kottas 2008).   Consequently, site specific herbivore, granivore and fungal impacts may be important when seed production is low or when the surrounding vegetation invades blowout penstemon habitat, bringing additional herbivory with it (Kottas 2008).  

Observations of seedlings in natural populations are rare.  The sand must remain damp for a period of two weeks at the appropriate time in the spring for the seeds to germinate and for the roots of seedlings to reach a depth where moisture is available constantly.  These limiting conditions are only met in one out of eight or ten years (Stubbendieck et al. 1997).  Yet, the blowout penstemon has a relatively short lifespan of six to eight years due to the species adaptation to constantly moving habitat and because the plant is an early successional species.  Therefore, even in blowouts where many seeds are produced, seedlings are rare. (Stubbendieck et al. 1997).

","Blowout penstemon is a short-lived perennial, frequently occurring in large, multi-stemmed clumps containing flowering and vegetative stems. Vegetative stems are commonly up to 1 foot tall, but can sometimes reach nearly 2 feet.  Vegetative stems are lax and curved upward from the base.  Plants often root from stem nodes if stem nodes are buried in sand.  The opposite, linear leaves are lax, 1 to 8 inches long and 1/4 inch to 1 inch wide, and are attached directly to the stem with no petiole.  

The leaves are greenish-blue and waxy, with no hairs, parallel veins and smooth edges.  The flowering stems are stout, up to about 1/2 inch in diameter, and usually 6 to 18 inches tall.  Leaves on the flowering stems are up to 3 inches wide, lance-shaped and stiff.  

The flowering head is cylindrical with 16 to 80 flowers arranged in several whorls.  Each whorl is located directly above a pair of stiff, overlapping, leaf-like bracts.  The bracts are longer than they are wide with heart-shaped bases.  The individual flowers are comprised of a 1 to 1-1/2 inches long, tube-shaped corolla that is milky blue, milky lavender or, rarely, white or pink.

Compared to other salmonids, bull trout have more specific habitat requirements that appear to influence their distribution and abundance. They need cold water to survive, so they are seldom found in waters where temperatures exceed 59 to 64 degrees (F). They also require stable stream channels, clean spawning and rearing gravel, complex and diverse cover, and unblocked migratory corridors. Bull trout may be distinguished from brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) by several characteristics: spots never appear on the dorsal (back) fin, and the spots that rest on the fish's olive green to bronze back are pale yellow, orange or salmon-colored. The bull trout's tail is not deeply forked as is the case with lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Bull trout exhibit two forms: resident and migratory. Resident bull trout spend their entire lives in the same stream/creek. Migratory bull trout move to larger bodies of water to overwinter and then migrate back to smaller waters to reproduce. An anadromous form of bull trout also exists in the Coastal-Puget Sound population, which spawns in rivers and streams but rears young in the ocean. Resident and juvenile bull trout prey on invertebrates and small fish. Adult migratory bull trout primarily eat fish. Resident bull trout range up to 10 inches long and migratory forms may range up to 35 inches and up to 32 pounds. Bull trout are currently listed coterminously as a threatened species. ",200

invertebrate consumers such as isopods, crayfish, and amphipods; and 3) and
8 predators (fish). This hypothesis was further supported by Graening (2002,

detritivores such as C. aculabrum (Graening 2005).","The type locality, Logan Cave, is a dendritic stream channel cave

This species is distinguished from related surface (epigean) species by a total lack of pigment, and by reduced eyes. It is distinguished from its closest troglobitic relatives by an acute or subacute apex of the anteromedian lobe of the epistorne. First form males (those with fully formed and hardened first pleopods, or reproductive appendages) are further separated from the closely related troglobitic species, C. setosus and C. tartarus, by the absence of a transverse groove separating the proximolateral lobe from the shaft on the first pleopod. It differs from first form males of another closely related cave species, C. zophonastes, by a longer central projection of the first pleopod which also has a shallow subapical notch (Hobbs and Brown 1987).

Also, a resident population exists among the foothills of the west slope of the Sierra Nevada range in California. There is little known about spring and fall migration as well as wintering distribution, but it is presumed to be similar to breeding habitat.",Black Rails are impacted largely by the degradation of suitable wetland habitat. The altering of water regimes on the East coast has allowed the common reed (Phragmites australis) to invade higher sections of salt marshes and degrade Black Rail habitat. There is little baseline information to estimate population trends. Coastal populations likely declined between the 1920s and 1970s before enaction of laws protecting coastal wetlands. ,"Nests in high portions of salt marshes, shallow freshwater marshes, wet meadows, and flooded grassy vegetation.","Adult Black Rails are small blackish marshbirds with a black bill which are difficult to see.

The known population for the Kauai cave wolf spider - perhaps fewer than 30 individuals - is regularly found in a single cave. Spiders in this family are characterized by a distinct eye pattern, including two particularly large eyes in the middle row. The most conspicuously diagnostic character of the Kauai cave spider is its complete lack of eyes. This character is unique among wolf spiders and its distinction justifies the recognition of a separate genus for this taxon. A few species of wolf spider have reduced eyes, including another cave-adapted species on the island of Hawaii, but only in the Kauai cave wolf spider are the eyes entirely absent. Adults of the Kauai cave wolf spider are about 12.7 to 19.0 millimeters (0.5 to 0.75 inches) in total length with a reddish-brown carapace, pale abdomen and bright orange legs. The hind margin of each chelicera (biting jaw) bears three large teeth, two situated basally, and third at the distal end of the chelicera. The tibiae of the two anterior pairs of legs have four pairs of ventral spines, and tarsi (ultimate segments) and metatarsi (penultimate segments) of all legs bear unusually long and silky trichobothria (sensory hairs). The Kauai cave wolf spider is a predator, and although blind, can detect the presence of potential food items and actively stalks its prey (Howarth 1983a). Although predation has not been observed in the field, the spider probably feeds primarily on the Kauai cave amphipod, and to a lesser extent on alien species of arthropods that periodically enter the cave system. Compared to most wolf spiders, the reproductive capacity of the Kauai cave wolf spider is extremely low, with only 15 to 30 eggs laid per clutch (Howarth 1981; Wells et al. 1983). Newly hatched spiderlings are unusually large, and carried on the back of the female for only a few days (Howarth 1991; Howarth and Mull 1992).",200

","Karner blues are found in the northern range of wild lupine habitat. Wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) is an attractively flowered plant that occurs in pine barrens and oak savannas in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, and Wisconsin. The Karner blue's habitat is a patchwork of pine and scrub oak scattered among open grassy areas. Historically, a network of these openings among the trees was maintained by wildfire and at one time the butterfly was found in this habitat in a nearly continuous narrow band across 10 states and one province. Today it has been eliminated from at least five of these states. 
",No information available,No information available,"The Karner blue butterfly usually has two generations, and thus two hatches, each year. In April, the first group of caterpillars hatch from eggs that were laid the previous year. The caterpillars feed only on wild lupine plant leaves. By about mid-May, the caterpillars pupate and adult butterflies emerge from their cocoon-like chrysalis by the end of May or in early June. These adults mate, laying their eggs in June on or near wild lupine plants. The eggs hatch in about one week and the caterpillars feed for about three weeks. They then pupate and the summer's second generation of adult butterflies appears in July. These adults mate and lay eggs that will not hatch until the following spring. 
","The Karner blue butterfly was first described more than a century ago in Karner, New York. It is a small butterfly, with a wingspan of about one inch. The male's wings are distinctively marked with a silvery or dark blue color.

A stomach content analysis by the City of Austin demonstrated that this salamander preys on varying proportions of ostracods, copepods, mayfly larvae, fly larvae, snails, water mites, aquatic beetles, and stone fly larvae depending on the location of the site (Bendik 2011b, pers. comm.). In addition, flatworms were found to be the primary food source for the related Barton Springs salamander (Gillespie 2013, p. 5), suggesting that flatworms may also contribute to the diet of the Jollyville Plateau salamander if present in the invertebrate community.","The Jollyville Plateau salamanderï¿½s spring-fed habitat is typically characterized by a depth of less than 1 ft (0.3 m) of cool, well oxygenated water (COA 2001, p. 128; Bowles et al. 2006, p. 118) supplied by the underlying Northern Segment of the Edwards Aquifer (Cole 1995, p. 33), the Trinity Aquifer (Johns 2012, COA, pers. comm.), or local alluvial sources (Johns 2012, COA, pers. comm.). The main aquifer that feeds this salamanderï¿½s habitat is generally small, shallow, and localized (Chippindale et al. 2000; p. 36; Cole 1995, p. 26). Jollyville Plateau salamanders are typically found near springs or seep outflows and likely require constant temperatures (Sweet 1982, pp. 433ï¿½434; Bowles et al. 2006, p. 117). Salamander densities are higher in pools and riffles and in areas with rubble, cobble, or boulder substrates rather than on solid bedrock (COA 2001, p. 128; Bowles et al. 2006, pp. 114ï¿½116).  Jollyville Plateau salamanders move an unknown depth into the interstitial spaces (empty voids between rocks) within the substrate, using these spaces for foraging habitat and cover from predators (Cole 1995, p. 24; Pierce and Wall 2011, pp. 16ï¿½17).  These spaces should have minimal sediment, as sediment fills interstitial spaces, eliminating resting places and also reducing habitat of the prey base (small aquatic invertebrates) (Oï¿½Donnell et al. 2006, p. 34).  Jollyville Plateau salamanders have been observed under rocks, leaf litter, and other vegetation (Bowles et al. 2006, pp. 114ï¿½116). There was a strong positive relationship between salamander abundance and the amount of available rocky substrate (Bowles et al. 2006, p. 114). Salamanders were more likely to use larger rocks (larger than 2.5 inches (in) or 64 millimeters (mm)) compared to gravel (Bowles et al. 2006, p. 114, 116).  If springs stop flowing and the surface habitat dries up, Jollyville Plateau salamanders are known to recede with the water table and persist in groundwater refugia until surface flow returns (Bendik 2011a, p. 31). Access to subsurface refugia allows populations some resiliency against drought events. ","The Jollyville Plateau salamander occurs in the Jollyville Plateau and Brushy Creek areas of the Edwards Plateau in northern Travis and southern Williamson Counties, Texas (Chippindale et al. 2000, pp. 35ï¿½36; Bowles et al. 2006, p. 112; Sweet 1982, p. 433). Upon classification as a species, Jollyville Plateau salamanders were known from Brushy Creek and, within the Jollyville Plateau, from Bull Creek, Cypress Creek, Long Hollow Creek, Shoal Creek, and Walnut Creek drainages (Chippindale et al. 2000, p. 36). Since it was described, the Jollyville Plateau salamander has also been documented within the Lake Creek drainage (Oï¿½Donnell et al. 2006, p. 1). Jollyville Plateau salamanders are known from 1 cave in the Cypress Creek drainage and 15 caves in the Buttercup Creek cave system in the Brushy Creek drainage (Chippindale et al. 2000, p. 49; Russell 1993, p. 21; Service 1999, p. 6; HNTB 2005, p. 60). There are 106 known surface sites for the Jollyville Plateau salamander.","Jollyville Plateau salamanders respire through gills and permeable skin (Duellman and Trueb 1986, p. 217). Adult salamanders are about 2 inches (in)(5 centimeters (cm)) long (Chippindale et al. 2000, pp. 32ï¿½42).  Surface-dwelling populations of Jollyville Plateau salamanders have large, well-developed eyes; wide, yellowish heads; blunt, rounded snouts; dark greenish-brown bodies; and bright yellowish-orange tails (Chippindale et al. 2000, pp. 33ï¿½34). Some cave forms of Jollyville Plateau salamanders, which are also entirely aquatic, exhibit caveassociated morphologies, such as eye reduction, flattening of the head, and dullness or loss of color (Chippindale et al. 2000, p. 37). Genetic analysis suggests a taxonomic split within this species that appears to correspond to major geologic and topographic features of the region (Chippindale 2010, p. 2). Chippindale (2010, pp. 5, 8) concluded that the Jollyville Plateau salamander exhibits a strong genetic separation between two lineages within the species: A ï¿½ï¿½Plateauï¿½ï¿½ clade that occurs in the Bull Creek, Walnut Creek, Shoal Creek, Brushy Creek, South Brushy Creek, and southeastern Lake Travis drainages; and a ï¿½ï¿½peripheralï¿½ï¿½ clade that occurs in the Buttercup Creek and northern Lake Travis drainages (Chippindale 2010, pp. 5ï¿½8). The study also suggests this genetic separation may actually represent two species (Chippindale 2010, pp. 5, 8).","Little is known about the reproductive habits of this species in the wild.  However, the Jollyville Plateau salamander is fully aquatic and, therefore, spends all of its life cycles in aquifer and spring waters. Eggs of central Texas Eurycea species are rarely seen on the surface, so it is widely assumed that eggs are laid underground(Gluesenkamp 2011, TPWD, pers. comm.; Bendik 2011b, COA, pers. comm.).  The detection of juveniles in all seasons suggests that reproduction occur year-round (Bendik 2011a, p. 26). However, juvenile abundance of Jollyville Plateau salamanders typically increases in spring and summer, indicating that there may be relatively more reproduction occurring in winter and early spring compared to other seasons (Bowles et al. 2006, p. 116).","The Jollyville Plateau salamander is a neotenic (does not transform into a terrestrial form) member of the family Plethodontidae. As neotenic salamanders, they retain external gills and inhabit aquatic habitats (springs, spring-runs, and wet caves) throughout their lives.  The Jollyville Plateau salamander occurs in the Jollyville Plateau and Brushy Creek areas of the Edwards Plateau in Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas.",200

Recent literature has documented the importance of terrestrial insects in the diet of stream salmonids (Baxter et al. 2005, pp. 201-214).  In lakes, small LCT feed largely on insects and zooplankton (Calhoun 1942, pp. 197-199; McAfee 1966, p. 228; Lea 1968, pp. 59-63), and larger LCT become piscivorous.  In Pyramid Lake, fish enter the diet when LCT reach 200 mm (7.9 in) in length, comprise over 50 percent of the diet at 300 mm (11.8 in), and represent almost 100 percent of the diet when LCT are over 500 mm (19.7 in) (Sigler et al. 1983, p. 16).  ","Specific habitat requirements for cutthroat trout are described in Hickman and Raleigh (1982, pp. 3-7) and summarized below.  Optimal stream habitat is characterized by clear, cold water with silt-free substrate and a 1:1 pool-riffle ratio. Streams should have a variety of habitats including areas with slow deep water, abundant instream cover (i.e., large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks), and relatively stable streamflow and temperature regimes.  Streambanks should be well vegetated to provide cover, shade, and bank stabilization. Lacustrine LCT populations have adapted to a wide variety of lake habitats from oligotrophic (with low nutrient levels and primary productivity) alpine lakes (e.g., Independence Lake) to large, productive desert terminal lakes (e.g., Pyramid Lake).  Unlike most freshwater fish species, LCT have been reported to tolerate alkalinity and total dissolved solid levels as high as 3,000 milligrams/liter (mg/L) (3,000 parts per million (ppm)) and 10,000 mg/L (10,000 ppm), respectively (Dickerson and Vinyard 1999a, pp. 510-514). ",No information available,No information available,"Lahontan cutthroat trout inhabit lakes and streams, but are obligatory stream spawners.  Distance traveled to spawning sites varies with stream size and strain of LCT (strain refers to locally adapted populations in a particular area or environment).  Populations in Pyramid and Winnemucca Lakes migrated as far as 160 kilometers (km) (100 miles (mi)) up the Truckee River into Lake Tahoe and its tributary streams (Sumner 1940, p. 217; Peacock and Kirchoff 2007, pp. 74-75).  Small, intermittent, tributary streams and headwater reaches are sometimes used as spawning sites (Coffin 1981, p. 31).  Spawning generally occurs from April through July, depending upon stream flow, elevation, and water temperature (McAfee 1966, p. 227; Lea 1968, pp. 68-69; Moyle 2002, p. 291; Rissler et al. 2006, pp. 13-15).  LCT in fluvial environments generally become sexually mature around year three (Ray et al. 2007, p. 40) while LCT in lacustrine environments become sexually mature between 3 and 4 years of age (Rissler et al. 2006, p. 35).  The Pilot Peak broodstock, derived from the Pilot Peak range in Utah and now known to have originated from the Truckee River watershed, sexually matures between 3 and 4 years with less than 10 percent maturing at age 5 and above (Jay Bigelow 2009, personal communication).

Large beetle larvae appear to be an important component of the diet.  These are obtained by stripping bark from recently dead or dying tree trunks and branches and by excavating rotted wood.  Members of the long-horned beetle family, Cerambycidae, were noted in the stomach of Ivory-billed Woodpecker several times, but many other species of wood-boring beetle larvae have also been documented.  The diet, based on historical accounts, included various nuts, such as pecans and acorn, and fruits, including hackberry, persimmon, wild grape, poison ivy and possibly swamp tupelo.  Due to the paucity of data on food items actually consumed by the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, limited conclusions can be drawn concerning preferences.  Current research with Pileated Woodpeckers may shed additional light on this issue.","The Ivory-billed Woodpecker was historically described as a resident of large, contiguous forests with numerous large trees.  A significant portion of the forest must also be in some stage of decay, providing a continuous supply of food.

Bottomland hardwood forests are frequently noted as important.  It is unclear if this view is biased by the scant information on habitat use having been gathered near the end of a long period of population decline.  Habitats occupied at the time most of the studies occurred may not have been typical or preferred by the species.  Rather, the habitat may have been occupied simply because it was the last suitable habitat available.

In Florida, baldcypress was noted as an important component of the forest used by Ivory-billed Woodpeckers, especially in conjunction with an adjacent pine forest.  Ivory-billed Woodpeckers used higher parts of first bottoms, bottomland forests infrequently flooded and forested primarily with species such as Nuttall oak (Quercus texana Buckley [syn., Q. nuttallii]), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), in northeastern Louisiana.  Researchers also observed that habitat used by Ivory-billed Woodpeckers was also highly favored by other species of woodpeckers, a high density of other woodpecker species being indicative of good Ivory-billed Woodpecker habitat.

Habitat requirements likely vary seasonally and with habitat conditions, population density, food resources, and other factors.  None of these influencing factors is understood for this species.  It is clear, however, that the Ivory-bill requires large tracts of forest for foraging and trees large enough for nesting and roosting.","Ivory-billed Woodpeckers, like other large woodpeckers, should have a greater food demand and, consequently, larger home ranges than smaller woodpeckers.  They would also have a greater sensitivity to habitat alterations.  This is supported by the fact that 3 other very large woodpecker species that weigh over 400 g (13 ounces) also have large home ranges and are sensitive to habitat alterations.  The Ivory-billed Woodpecker was known to fly distances of at least several kilometers each day between favored roost sites and feeding areas.  Such movements are associated with maintaining large home ranges.  However; information on daily movements is limited to one study.

The ecology of the species likely includes substantial spatial and temporal flexibility, due to their use of disturbed sites containing increased volumes of stressed and dead trees.  Ivory-billed Woodpeckers could have expanded home range sizes in sub-optimal habitats, such as in the regenerating southern forests.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is migratory, however, the species may become nomadic in response to a fluctuating and undependable food supply.  Researchers have reported the Ivory-billed Woodpecker to be a late riser, leaving its roost after sunrise.",No information available,"Breeding phenology (annual cycle) is poorly known.  Generally, it is thought that breeding occurs between January and April.  Nest cavities are excavated in a dead or dying portion of a live tree, although in some cases a dead tree may be used.  Nest cavities have ranged from 4.6 m to over 21 m up the nest tree with nests rarely being excavated below 9 m from the trees base.  The outside diameters of the limb supporting the cavities ranged from 33 to 55.9 cm.

Reported clutch size ranges from 1-5 eggs, but most reports are of clutches of 2 to 4 eggs.  Incubation period has never been quantified for an Ivory-billed Woodpecker, but if it parallels the measured incubation period of the Magellanic Woodpecker, it takes about 20 days.  This also approximates one historical estimate for the gestation period of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker.  Both sexes of the Ivory-bill incubate the eggs, and it has been documented that both parents feed the young for a period of about 35 days until the young have fledged.  The young may be fed by the parents for an additional two months and forage with and roost near the parents into the next breeding season.","The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is noted for its striking black-and-white plumage; robust white, chisel-tipped bill; lemon-yellow eye; and pointed crest.  Males are red from the nape to the top of their crest with black outlining the front of the crest.  Females have a solid black crest which is somewhat more pointed and slightly recurved to point forward.

The bases of the males red crest feathers are white and may allow a spot of white to be displayed on the side of the crest when the feathers are fully erect.  Morphological data from live birds are lacking.  Available information from historical sources suggests the Ivory-billed Woodpecker has an overall length of approximately 48-51 centimeters (cm), an estimated wingspan of 76-80 cm, and a weight of 454-567 grams (g).  These figures are based on values of 1 pound and 20 ounces given in the historical records.  However, no clearly documented data are available.

However, streams are oligotrophic, meaning high in dissolved oxygen and low in nutrients. Thus, the amount of typical dietary components that are available to many other freshwater mussels, which occur in a eutrophic system, are markedly lower in the oligotrophic system where Louisiana pearlshells are found. For this reason, the feeding behavior and dietary components of Louisiana pearlshells warrants further review. Louisiana pearlshells are filter feeders and generally orient themselves on or near the substrate surface to take in food and oxygen from the water column.  Juveniles lack developed filter feeding structures and are typically pedal feeders that burrow completely beneath the substrate surface and bring food particles that adhere to the extended foot inside the shell for ingestion. 

","The Louisiana pearlshell requires clear, relatively shallow headwater streams, with a moderately swift current and rocky outcroppings. They are often associated with the riffle area of the stream and not typically found in stagnant pools or deeper sandy areas, unless they are washed there by high flow events. Water is slightly acidic, low in calcium, low in nutrients, and high in  dissolved oxygen. ","Endemic to Grant and Rapides Parishes, Louisiana, in second and third order headwater streams on the Kisatchie National Forest and privately owned land.",No information available,"The reproductive biology of the Louisiana pearlshell is similar to other dioecious (having separate male and female sexes), freshwater mussel species, in that fertilization occurs after females siphon and filter sperm that males release into the water during the spawning period.  The sexes are monomorphic (males and females appear the same).  Females brood developing embryos on the marsupia of all four gills until releasing fully developed glochidia into the water.  These glochidia must then attach to a species-specific host fish within a short time after being released into the water or the released glochidia will die. Once glochidia successfully attach to the gills of the host fish, glochidial metamorphosis takes place over about a month.  After glochidial metamorphosis is complete, the newly metamorphosed mussels are released from the host fish and float downward to settle on the streambed. Once reaching the sediment in suitable habitat, the final developmental stage into a sexually mature adult begins. It is not yet certain at what age the Louisiana pearlshell reaches sexual maturity, but recent published literature indicates 5 years. Juvenile mussels are capable of pedal movement to attempt to find suitable habitat if the location drop-off occurs is unsuitable.

Several fish species have been suggested as potential host for the Louisiana pearlshell, but until 2016 all reports of potential host fish were made from observing glochidia encysted on the gills of wild caught fish, with none confirmed from observation of metamorphosis into transformers.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery estimated reproductive timing of the species in the wild by observation of gravid females in the wild. The grass pickerel is documented as suitable host fish to produce juveniles in captivity. ","The Louisiana pearlshell mussel is oblong and kidney shaped. Umbos (the inflated dorsal part of the shell) are even with or slightly extended past the hinge line.

More recent analyses of bat guano collected from occupied bat houses at Babcock-Webb WMA indicated that the samples contained high percentages of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera (Marks 2013).","ROOSTING HABITAT: Includes forest and other areas with tall, mature trees or other areas with suitable roost structures.  Forest is defined as all types including:  pine flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods, pine rocklands, royal palm hammocks, mixed or hardwood hammocks, cypress, sand pine scrub, or other forest types.  Artificial roosting structure includes buildings, bridges, and bat houses.  More specifically, this includes habitat for roosting and rearing of offspring.  Such habitat provides structural features for rest, digestion of food, social interaction, mating, rearing of young, protection from sunlight and adverse weather, and cover to reduce predation risks for adults and young.  In general, roosting habitat is characterized by:  tall mature live or dead trees, tree snags, and trees with cavities, hollows, deformities, decay, crevices, or loose bark.  Structural characteristics are of primary importance.  

FORAGING HABITAT - Sources of drinking water and prey and relatively open (i.e., uncluttered) areas to find and catch prey.  This includes:  open fresh water, permanent or seasonal freshwater wetlands, wetland and upland forests, and wetland and upland shrub.  In urban and residential areas, drinking water, prey base, and suitable foraging conditions (i.e., open habitat structure) can be found in relatively small patches of natural or semi-natural habitat. ","Foraging and dispersal distances and home range sizes for the Florida bonneted bat are not known and have not been studied in great detail (K. Gillies, in litt. 2012; G. Marks, pers. comm. 2012; H. Ober, in litt. 2012; J. Gore, pers. comm. 2013).  Like other molossids, the speciesÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ morphological characteristics (e.g., narrow wings, high wing-aspect ratios (long, narrow wings)) make bats in the Eumops genus well-adapted for efficient, rapid, and prolonged flight in open areas (Vaughan 1966; Findley et al. 1972; Freeman 1981; Norberg and Rayner 1987; Vaughan 1959 as cited in Best et al. 1997; Voigt and Holderied 2012).  Based upon these characteristics, bonneted bats can be expected to range (24-km (15-mi)) or more on foraging bouts, similar to the UnderwoodÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s mastiff bat (E. underwoodi) in Arizona (Tibbitts et al. 2002; J. Gore, pers. comm. 2013).  The Florida bonneted bat is, therefore, capable of dispersing large distances and generally adapted for low cost, swift, long distance travel from roost site to foraging areas (K. Gillies, in litt. 2012; H. Ober, in litt. 2012).  Given this, it seems likely that foraging areas may be located fairly long distances from roost sites (H. Ober, in litt. 2012).  The species is presumed to have very large home ranges (H. Ober, pers. comm. 2014).  Research to better understand movements and home range size is underway.",No information available,"The Florida bonneted bat is active year-round and has an extensive breeding season.  Compared with other species of bats in Florida, it is unique in that it has characteristics more common to tropical species than temperate species and a breeding season that extends past August(Timm and Genoways 2004; Ober et al. 2016). Females continue to give birth to young after that time; newborns have been found in September and October (J. Gore, pers. comm. 2017), and non-volant pups have been found in roosts through December (Ober et al. 2016).","The Florida bonneted bat is a member of the Molossidae (free-tailed bats) family within the order Chiroptera. The species is the largest bat in Florida(Owre 1978; Belwood 1992). Males and females are not significantly different in size, and there is no pattern of size-related geographic variation in this species(Timm and Genoways 2004). Members of the genus Eumops have large, rounded pinnae (ears), arising from a single point or joined medially on the forehead (Best et al. 1997). Ears are joined at the midline of the head. This feature, along with its large size, distinguishes the Florida bonneted bat from the smaller Brazilian (=Mexican)free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). Eumops are among the narrowest of all molossids (Freeman 1981, as cited in Best et al. 1997) and are well-adapted for rapid, prolonged flight (Vaughan 1959 as cited in Best et al. 1997). This wing structure is conducive to high-speed flight in open areas (Findley et al. 1972 as cited in Best et al. 1997). The Florida bonneted batÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s fur is short and glossy, with hairs sharply bicolored with a white base (Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004). Like other molossids, color is highly variable, varying from black to brown to brownish-gray or cinnamon brown with ventral pelage (fur) paler than dorsal (Owre 1978; Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004).",200

Insects comprise the majority of the animal diet throughout most of the year (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1984).  Acorns are by far the most important plant food (Fitzpatrick et al. 1991); surplus acorns are frequently cached in the ground (DeGange et al. 1989).","The Florida scrub-jay lives only in the scrub and scrubby flatwoods habitats of Florida.  This type of habitat grows only on nearly pure, excessively well-drained sandy soils, and occurs along present coastlines in Florida, on paleodunes of the high central ridges and other ancient shorelines of the Florida Peninsula, and inland on scattered alluvial deposits bordering several major rivers.  This species' habitat is dominated by a layer of evergreen oaks [myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia) and/or Archbold oak (Q. inopina), sand live oak (Q. geminata), Chapman oak (Q. chapmanii), and runner oak (Q. minima)], rusty lyonia (Lyonia ferruginea), and Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides).  This layer is rarely greater than two meters in height, except where fire has been suppressed.  Ground cover is sparse, dominated by saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) and sand palmetto (Sabal etonia).  Bare sand patches are essential for foraging and acorn-caching.  Slash pines (Pinus elliottii) and sand pines (P. clausa) are widely scattered with  usually less than 15 percent cover (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996a).","The Florida scrub jay is endemic to peninsular Florida.  The estimated population is between 7,000 to 11,000 individuals (Breininger 1989; Fitzpatrick et al. 1991; Fitzpatrick et al. 1994).  Scrub has been significantly reduced by development activity and now typically occurs only in scattered and often small patches in peninsular Florida (Fitzpatrick et al. 1991).  Florida scrub-jay populations formerly inhabited 39 of 40 peninsular Florida counties, from Levy, Gilchrist, Alachua, Clay, and Duval Counties southward.  Its range currently occurs from Flagler, Marion, and Citrus counties south to Collier, Glades, and Palm Beach Counties, with the largest remaining populations in Brevard County (especially coastal scrubs of Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Kennedy Space Center), Highlands County (near Sebring, Lake Placid, and Venus, and on Avon Park Air Force Range), and in Marion County (at Ocala National Forest).",No information available,"Florida scrub-jays have a social structure that involves cooperative breeding, a trait that the western North American species of scrub-jays do not exhibit (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1984).  Florida scrub-jays live in groups ranging from two (a single mated pair) up to large extended families of eight adults and one to four juveniles.  Fledgling scrub-jays remain with the breeding pair in their natal territory as ""helpers,"" forming a closely-knit cooperative family group.  Pre-breeding numbers are generally reduced to either a pair with no helpers or families of three or four individuals (a pair plus one or two helpers).

To become a breeder, a scrub-jay must acquire a territory and mate.  Evidence presented by Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick (1984) suggests that Florida scrub-jays are permanently monogomous.  The pair retains ownership and sole breeding privileges in their particular territory year after year.  Courtship to form the pair is lengthy and ritualized, and involves posturing and vocalizations made by the male to the female (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996a).  Copulation between the pair is generally out of sight of other jays (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1984).  Age at first breeding varies from 1 to 7 years, although most individuals become breeders between 2 and 4 years of age (Fitzpatrick and Woolfenden 1988).  Persistent breeding populations of Florida scrub-jays exist only where there are scrub oaks in sufficient quantity to provide an ample winter acorn supply, cover from predators, and nest sites during the spring (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996a).   They typically nest at the edge of an oak thicket, near an open area.

During the breeding season, which runs from March through June, average production of young is two fledglings per pair, per year (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1990; Fitzpatrick et al. 1994), and the presence of helpers improves fledgling success (Mumme 1992).  Annual productivity must average at least two young fledged per pair for a population of scrub-jays to maintain long-term stability (Fitzpatrick et al.  1991).","The plumage of adult males and females looks alike, but males are slightly larger than females. The head, nape, wings, and tail are pale blue. The back and belly are pale gray. The throat and chest are white and bordered by a blue gray bib. Juveniles differ in appearance from adults in that they have dull or dark brown upperparts. Florida scrub jays look similar to other jays (Cyanocitta), but do not have a crest, white-tipped wings or tail feathers, or black barring.",200

Recovering a Prairie Orchid - 2003 Endangered Species Tech Bulletin article at http://www.fws.gov/endangered/bulletin/2003/07-12/14-15.pdf","This orchid is a perennial herb that grows from an underground tuber. Flowering begins from late June to early July, and lasts for 7 to 10 days. Blossoms often rise just above the height of the surrounding grasses and sedges. The more exposed flower clusters are more likely to be visited by the hawkmoth pollinators, though they are also at greater risk of being eaten by deer. Seed capsules mature over the growing season and are dispersed by the wind from late August through September.

",No information available,No information available,"This is based on information extrapolated from the Big Sandy crayfish (Thoma 2009, entire; Thoma 2010, entire). The general life cycle pattern of the species is 2 to 3 years of growth, maturation in the third year, and first mating in midsummer of the third or fourth year.  Following midsummer mating, the annual cycle involves egg laying in late summer or fall, spring release of young, and late spring/early summer molting.  The likely lifespan is thought to be 5 to 7 years, with the possibility of some individuals reaching 10 years of age.","The Guyandotte River crayfish (Cambarus veteranus) is a freshwater, tertiary burrowing crustacean of the Cambaridae family.  Tertiary burrowing crayfish do not exhibit complex burrowing behavior; instead, they shelter in shallow excavations under loose cobbles and boulders on the stream bottom.  The species is closely related to the Big Sandy crayfish (C. callainus) and the two share many basic physical characteristics.  Adult body lengths range from 75.7 to 101.6 millimeters (mm) (3.0 to 4.0 inches (in)), and the cephalothorax (main body section) is streamlined and elongate, and has two well-defined cervical spines.  The elongate convergent rostrum (the beak-like shell extension located between the crayfishs eyes) lacks spines or tubercles (bumps).  The gonopods (modified legs used for reproductive purposes) of Form I males (those in the breeding stage) are bent 90 degrees to the gonopod shaft (Loughman 2014, p. 1).  Diagnostic characteristics that distinguish the Big Sandy crayfish from the Guyandotte River crayfish include the formers narrower, more elongate rostrum; narrower, more elongate chelea (claw); and lack of a well-pronounced lateral impression at the base of the claws immovable finger (Thoma et al. 2014, p. 551).  

Carapace (shell) coloration ranges from olive brown to light green, and the cervical groove is outlined in light blue, aqua, or turquoise.  The rostral margins and post orbital (behind the eye) ridges are crimson red.  The abdominal terga (dorsal plates covering the crayfishs abdomen) range from olive brown to light brown to light green and are outlined in red.  The walking legs of the Guyandotte River crayfish are blue and the chelae range from blue green to light blue (Loughman 2014, p. 12; Thoma et al. 2014, p. 547).

The turtles are attracted to lagoons and shoals with an abundance of marine grass and algae. Open beaches with a sloping platform and minimal disturbance are required for nesting. Green turtles apparently have a strong nesting site fidelity and often make long distance migrations between feeding grounds and nesting beaches. Hatchlings have been observed to seek refuge and food in Sargassum rafts.","The green turtle has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Major green turtle nesting colonies in the Atlantic occur on Ascension Island, Aves Island, Costa Rica, and Surinam. Within the U.S., green turtles nest in small numbers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, and in larger numbers in Florida. The Florida green turtle nesting aggregation is recognized as a regionally significant colony. About 200 to 1,100 females are estimated to nest on beaches in the continental U.S. In the U.S. Pacific, over 90 percent of nesting throughout the Hawaiian archipelago occurs at the French Frigate Shoals, where about 200 to 700 females nest each year. Elsewhere in the U.S. Pacific, nesting takes place at scattered locations in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Guam, and American Samoa. In the western Pacific, the largest green turtle nesting aggregation in the world occurs on Raine Island, Australia, where thousands of females nest nightly in an average nesting season. In the Indian Ocean, major nesting beaches occur in Oman where 6,000 to 20,000 females are reported to nest annually.","The term ""green"" applies not to the external coloration, but to the color of the turtle's subdermal fat.","The nesting season varies with the locality. In the Southeastern U.S., it is roughly June through September. Nesting occurs nocturnally at 2, 3, or 4-year intervals. Only occasionally do females produce clutches in successive years. A female may lay as a many as nine clutches within a nesting season (overall average is about 3.3 nests per season) at about 13-day intervals. Clutch size varies from 75 to 200 eggs, with an average clutch size of 136 eggs reported for Florida. Incubation ranges from about 45 to 75 days, depending on incubation temperatures.

In Texas, the birds are thought to take advantage of insect blooms, large insect populations, associated with different plants as the growing season progresses (Kroll 1974, p. 41).  For example, broad-leaved trees, especially oaks, are particularly important in providing habitat for insects during the first part of the nesting season (Oberholser 1974, p. 751; Kroll 1974, p. 41; Pulich 1976, p. 113).  Later in the season, GCWAs are frequently seen foraging in Ashe juniper, young live oaks and Texas (Spanish) oaks (Quercus buckleyi), and shin (scalybark) oak (Q. sinuate) brush where increases in insects have been documented (Beardmore 1994, pp. 32-33; Kroll 1974, p. 41; Wharton et al. 1996, pp. 9-10; Griscom and Sprunt 1957, p. 142).  On the wintering grounds, GCWAs prefer feeding in oaks, even when the dominant tree species are pines (Thompson 1995, p. 12; Rappole 1996, p. 15).","Nesting:  
	Typical GCWA nesting habitat is found in tall, closed canopy, dense, mature stands of Ashe juniper mixed with trees such as Texas oak, shin oak, live oak, Lacey oak (Q. laceyi), post oak (Q. stellata), Texas ash (Fraxinus texana), cedar elm, hackberry (Celtis reticulata), bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), little walnut (Juglans microcarpa), and escarpment cherry (Prunus serotina) (Oberholser 1974, p. 751; Kroll 1974, pp. 20, 34; Pulich 1974, pp. 65-66, Campbell 2003, p. 1).  This type of woodland generally grows in relatively moist areas such as steep-sided canyons, slopes, and adjacent uplands (Keddy-Hector et al. 1998, p. 3; Riskind and Diamond 1988, pp. 1-3; Kroll 1974, p. 34).  GCWAs can also be found in drier, upland juniper-oak (i.e. Texas oak, live oak, post oak, blackjack oak (Q. merilandica)) woodlands over flat topography (Oberholser 1974, p. 751).

	While GCWA nesting habitat is a combination of mature Ashe juniper and hardwood trees, the composition of woody vegetation varies within suitable GCWA habitat across the range with Ashe juniper often, but not always, being the dominant species (Pulich 1974, pp. 65-66; Kroll 1974, p. 34).  Mature juniper trees vary in age and growth form, depending on site factors (Kroll 1974, p. 6; Pulich 1974, p. 65).  Generally, trees required for nesting habitat are at least 4.6 meters (15 feet) tall with a trunk diameter of about 15.2 centimeters (6 inches) at 0.6 meters (2 feet) above the ground (Kroll 1980, pp. 63-64).  The essential element is that juniper trees have shredding bark, which happens at the base of the tree around 20 years old and at the crown around 41 years old (Kroll 1974, p. 17).

Wintering:  
	Golden-cheeked warblers winter in the mountainous regions (highlands) of southern Mexico (Chiapas) and Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua) (Oberholser 1974, p. 750; Ridgeway 1902, p. 566; Pulich 1976, p. 62; Rappole et al. 1999, pp. 768-769; Komar 2008, p. 7).  GCWA wintering habitat is steep with numerous small drainages and is characterized as mature pine-oak woodland (Rappole et al. 1999, p. 765; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  These woodlands consist typically of two pine species - ocote (Pinus oocarpa) and pinabete (P. maximinoi) and two groups of oaks called encino and roble (Rappole et al. 1999, p. 765; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  Encino oaks have shiny narrow, elliptical, or oblong leaves (Q. sapotifolia, Q. eliptica, Q. elongata, Q. cortesii) and roble oak leaves are large and lobed (Q. segoviensis, Q. purulhana, Q. rugosa) (Rappole et al. 1999, p. 765; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  GCWAs have also been documented using artificially planted pine groves and shrub, which includes brush and young shrubby trees (Vidal et al. 1994, pp. 685-686).  The understory is dominated by young oaks, both encino and robles, but also includes sweetgum (Liquidambar styracilfua) (Kroll 1980, p. 64; Rappole 1996, p. 7).  This type of habitat, and therefore GCWAs, are typically found at elevations between 1,300 to 1,500 meters (4,265 to 4,921 feet) (Rappole et al. 1999, p 765; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  However, GCWAs have been found as low as 1,070 meters (3,510 feet) and as high as 2,350 meters (7,709 feet) (Rappole 1996, p. 7).

	Golden-cheeked warblers are associated with mixed species flocks, typically consisting of other warbler species, on the wintering grounds (Rappole et al. 1999, pp. 767, 769; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  Usually there is just one GCWA per flock; however, as many as twelve have been observed together in one flock (Rappole et al. 1999, p. 767; Kroll 1980, p. 64).  The low number of GCWAs per flock is thought to occur because of intraspecific competition, similar to the territoriality on the breeding grounds (Rappole et al. 1999, p. 768).","	In the period July-August GCWAs migrate southward from Texas through the pine-oak woodlands of eastern Mexico through the Sierra Madre Oriental (Oberholser 1974, p. 750; Ridgeway 1902, p. 566; Pulich 1976, pp. 55, 58; Perrigo and Booher 1994, p. 15).  The latest record of a GCWA in Texas is August 18 in Kerr County (Pulich 1976, p. 55).  The earliest arrival date in Chiapas, Mexico, is August 5 (Vidal et al. 1994, p. 686; Pulich 1976, p. 57).  GCWAs begin returning to Texas in late February, but have been documented in Chiapas, Mexico as late as April 13 (Vidal et al. 1994, p. 686).  The earliest arrival date on the breeding grounds in Texas is March 2; however, most arrive mid-March (Pulich 1976, p. 54).",No information available,"	Golden-cheeked warblers breed exclusively in the mixed Ashe juniper/deciduous woodlands of the Edwards Plateau, Lampasas Cut-Plain, and Llano Uplift regions of central Texas (Pulich 1976, pp. 67-68; Oberholser 1974, p. 751; Kroll 1974, p. 45).  The birds are dependent on Ashe juniper (Juniperus asheii) for fine bark strips used in nest construction (Pulich 1976, p. 86; Kroll 1980, p. 61).  Although nests may be placed in various species of trees, such as juniper, live oak (Quercus fusiformis), and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), all nests contain strips of Ashe juniper bark typically woven together with spider webs and lined with feathers, fine grass, or hair (Oberholser 1974, pp. 751, 753; Kroll 1974, p. 44; Pulich 1976, pp. 83, 86-87; Griscom and Sprunt 1957, p. 143). 

	Within suitable nesting habitat, male GCWAs occupy an area, called a territory, which is vigorously defended against all other male GCWAs (Pulich 1976, p. 76; Kroll 1974, pp. 28, 43).  Nesting territories are typically from 1.2 to 2.4 hectares (3 to 6 acres), depending on habitat quality.  Over multiple years, site fidelity to a particular territory has been observed (Pulich 1976, pp. 77, 80, 130; Maas-Burleigh 1998, pp. 12-13; Keddy-Hector et al. 1998, p. 6).  Male GCWAs can often be located through their territorial song, described as a rather hurried, buzzy tweah-tweah-twee-sy (Oberholser 1974, p. 752).  Single, sharp chipping calls can frequently be heard by both male and female GCWAs (Oberholser 1974, p. 752; Pulich 1976, p. 119; Keddy-Hector 1992, pp. 2-5-2-6).

The female GCWA does most of the work of nest building and incubating the eggs (Pulich 1976, p. 82; Oberholser 1974, p. 751).  Nesting in the same tree for two or more years in succession has been noted (Pulich 1976, p. 82).  The cup-like nest is commonly in the upper two-thirds of the available canopy foliage (typically 15 ft. or higher), neatly tucked into the fork of a vertical limb, and camouflaged to blend with the bark of the tree (Pulich 1976, pp. 85, 87-88; Oberholser 1974, pp. 751, 753; Kroll 1974, pp. 29, 45; Pulich 1976, p. 87).  The male stays close by singing his distinctive song and defending his territory (Pulich 1976, pp. 82-83).
 
	During April, a single clutch of three to four eggs is laid (Pulich 1976, pp. 90, 92; Bent 1953, p. 319).  GCWAs usually nest only once per season, unless a nest is lost to accident or predation (Pulich 1976, pp. 88, 95).  The eggs hatch in 12 days, and both parents care for the young (Pulich 1976, p. 96; Oberholser 1974, p. 751).  After the young hatch, male singing declines, although they can still be heard into June (Oberholser 1974, p. 751; Pulich 1976, pp. 52, 119).  Nestlings fledge (leave the nest) eight or nine days after hatching, but remain in the vicinity of the territory for at least four weeks while being cared for by both parents (Pulich 1976, pp. 107, 110; Oberholser 1974, p. 751; Kroll 1974, p. 28).  

	Golden-cheeked warblers have been found in patches of habitat smaller than 10 hectares (24.7 acres); however, successful reproduction doesnt occur in patches less than 20 hectares (49.48 acres) (Arnold et al. 1996, p. 19; Butcher 2008, p. 28).  Reproductive success of GCWAs has been shown to be greater in larger, unfragmented patches of habitat over smaller, fragmented patches (Maas-Burleigh 1998, p. 16; Coldren 1998, pp. 74-75).  This can be a result of things like increases in predators near edges, a reduction in mate attraction as a result of a reduction in vocalization by males due to the presence of those predators, or a reduction in attracting a female due to lower suitability as a nesting site (Coldren 1998, pp. 95, 97, 102; Arnold et al. 1996, p. 25).  ","	The golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia, GCWA) is a small, neo-tropical songbird weighing about 10 grams (0.34 ounces) and is about 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) long (Pulich 1976, pp. 126-128).
  
	Adult GCWA males have yellow cheeks outlined in black with a thin black line through each eye and extending backwards from the eye (Oberholser 1974, p. 750; Ridgway 1902, p. 565).  Upper breast, throat, and back are black, and the lower breast and belly are white with some lateral black spotting or streaking (Oberholser 1974, pp. 750, 753; Ridgway 1902, p. 565).  Wings are blackish with two white wingbars, and tail feathers are black, except the outermost tail feather on each side is white with a black shaft line (Oberholser 1974, p. 753; Ridgway 1902, p. 565).  The beak, legs, and feet are black, and eyes are dark brown (Oberholser 1974, p. 753). 

	Adult GCWA females are similar to adult males but less strikingly marked (Pulich 1976, p. 121).  For example, the cheeks and center of the throat of females are yellowish, grading to pale buff or white on the abdomen (Oberholser 1974, pp. 750, 753; Ridgway 1902, p. 566). Additionally, the back is dark olive-green with thin black streaks (Oberholser 1974, p. 750; Ridgway 1902, p. 566).  Sides of the throat are black with feathers tipped in white, and the flanks (sides) are covered with black streaks (Oberholser 1974, p. 753; Ridgway 1902, p. 566). ",200

Greenbacks also feed on crustaceans such as fresh-water shrimp, aquatic insects, and small fish.","This species inhabits cold water streams and cold water lakes with adequate stream spawning habitat present during spring.  Field studies however, have indicated that water temperatures averaging 7.8°C or below in July may have an adverse effect on greenback fry (young fish) survival and recruitment. 

In general, trout require different habitat types for different life stages:  juvenile (protective cover and low velocity flow, as in side channels and small tributaries); spawning (riffles with clean gravels); over-winter (deep water with low velocity flow and protective cover); and adult (juxtaposition of slow water areas for resting and fast water areas for feeding, with protective cover from boulders, logs, overhanging vegetation or undercut banks).  Both water quality and quantity are important.  Greenbacks, like other cutthroat trout, generally require clear, cold, well-oxygenated water.
","The original distribution of the subspecies is not precisely known due to its rapid decline in the 1800s.  It is assumed that the original distribution included all mountain and foothill habitats of the South Platte and Arkansas river drainage systems, including drainages at lower elevations than it occupies today.  The subspecies may have extended as far east as present day Greeley, Colorado, during the mid-1800s.

Currently, 145 populations, in 227.7 kilometers (km) of streams and 166.74 hectares (ha) of lakes have been documented within greenback historic range on the eastern side of the Continental Divide.
","The main reasons cited for the subspecies decline are hybridization, competition with nonnative salmonids, and overharvest.  New threats have arisen, or have become more prevalent, and these include: increased human population growth within the range of the subspecies along with potential for new water depletions; new introductions of nonnative species; fragmentation and genetic isolation of small populations; the effects of fire and firefighting with chemical retardants; and the effects of global climate change.

Additional threats are those whose impacts are limited to specific populations and do not occur at a rangewide level, and these include: the ongoing negative effects of past mining operations on water quality; the impacts of grazing, logging, and road and trail construction and use on riparian habitat and streambanks, causing increased erosion, sediment deposition, and in turn elevated water temperatures and higher turbidity; and the co-occurrence of nonnative salmonids with greenback populations.
","Spawning occurs usually from late May to mid-July in higher elevations. Male cutthroat spawn first at age two, and females mature a year later. Females build an egg pit in gravel generally three to eight inches deep and one foot in diameter. A 10-inch female will lay about 800 eggs. Larger fish of about four to seven pounds will lay up to 6,000 eggs.","Greenback cutthroat trout are coldwater fish belonging to the trout, salmon and whitefish family.

Minimum size of suitable habitats is unclear, but have been  found in areas as small as 2-3 acres depending on the quality of the mosaic.  Typically found below 4,500 feet of elevation. ","Most individuals do not migrate, but have minor seasonal changes in their activity areas.  Juveniles do disperse to nearby habitats.  The recent extension of the range north along the lower Colorado River implies that rails are capable of longer distance movements, although the presence of scattered habitat patches for resting is likely important. Seasonal availability of food may be important factor in the need to migrate greater distances.

It is important to note that in addition to juveniles not being able to fly until end of September, adults have a basic pre-body molt between May-August, with simultaneous molt of rectrices (tail feathers) and remiges (wing feathers) which both allow for flight.  These flightless adults are found between mid-July and the end of September (Eddleman 1989, p. 6).     ","Important threats:  loss of marsh habitat through channelization, dredging/filling activities, decline in quality of marsh habitat due to build-up residual vegetation (dead stems and leaves of cattails or bulrush) that clogs movement through the vegetation, and selenium contamination of the prey base.
